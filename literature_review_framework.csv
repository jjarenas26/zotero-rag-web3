Everex partners with banks targeting underbanked populations and allows workers to send money home without paying high remittance fees. Merchants must be partnered with SureRemit and accept tokens. Everex needs to have licensed exchange partners in the country of receipt to exchange tokens into local currency. Cost of Compliance Among Different Regulatory Environments SureRemit leverages the Stellar platform and also acquires partner merchants to bypass different regulatory environments altogether by settling Remit tokens with ﬁat currency via Stellar. - The Token can only be used to make purchases with partner merchants. Therefore  the money cannot be used if a partner merchant does not accept the Remit token. - Interoperability SureRemit has standardized the process regardless of country. The same information is required no matter where or with whom the transaction is placed. Everex has trusted banking partners in the countries they interact with  thus promising a 1:1 conversion rate of their eFiat stablecoins. - For the stable coins to be redeemed in Fiat currency  Everex must have local banking partners that operate within that currency. Otherwise  the eFiat cannot be sent/redeemed. Risk RemitToken is not subject to the volatility of currency exchange rates. Immediate and continuous liquidity provided by Stellar allows for the issuance and trading of tokens immediately. Therefore  they are not subject to the risk of exchange rates. The Everex Token is a dollar-pegged stablecoin  ensuring that the money being transferred is equivalent to the same ﬁat currency that is being transferred. The stablecoins used by Everex when redeemed from eFiat to ﬁat are subject to conversion rates that can be volatile. - Table 10.

Vision general,9,95TMJST6,Blockchain as IoT Economy Enabler: A Review of Architectural Aspects,2022,Introduction,The Internet of Things (IoT) is a network of tiny devices connected over the Internet to observe the physical world  gather data  and consciously act on it in a useful way. Billions of connected IoT devices are expected to bring a substantial added value for communities and for individuals  also in view of the fact that IoT is tightly connected with several well-known trends  such as Big Data  smart cities  and Industry 4.0  which promise to deeply change many aspects of our lives in the future. As an example  the unprecedented amount of data gathered by billions of IoT sensors will bring us the ability to get new insights and actionable intelligence regarding our world [1 2]. The pervasive presence of smart connected devices will enable the development of innovative services to improve our lives [3] and to face new and unexpected challenges  such as the COVID-19 outbreak [4]  and private and public objects (i.e.  things) will be available to anyone for renting  even for a short time  to support a new form of shared economy [5]. The general problem of giving a reward to subjects that contribute to this novel added value ecosystem is not only an economic or business-related question. Many IoT applications are peculiar regarding the amount of involved users  the volume and diversity of generated data  the frequency of economic transactions and their latency constraints  J. Sens.

Hence  related technical and architectural aspects are by themselves an interesting cross-cutting dimension for many IoT applications. This is even more compelling if we observe that decentralization is going to be a fundamental aspect of evolved IoT ecosystems. In fact  a single organization handling a vast amount of heterogeneous and pervasive IoT devices is not simply unrealistic  but also unfeasible. We expect that in the more complex scenarios  many organizations will contribute to a single IoT ecosystem. Furthermore  the pervasive nature of IoT deployments usually requires the involvement of end-users that buy  deploy  and contribute their devices to an ecosystem on the basis of some kind of future advantage. Ecosystems of this kind grow as more people are willing to contribute  and not (only) under the pressure of centralized investments.,latency; tps; security,weak,0.0023,1.2,1.0,0,0.3416

Over the years  the institutions part of the BFSI sector kept increasing  and now the umbrella of BFSI is huge. One such new instrument which has become very popular nowadays is mutual funds. Mutual funds have helped people from all sections of society to grow their wealth and improve their standard of living. Another example of the growth can be seen in terms of the new types of insurance that have entered in the last decade or so. The actual benefits from this sector has been experienced by the people only after technology has become an integral part of this sector. Technology has helped grow the sector by inventing new services and products  making the current processes more efficient. In the past  institutions just made use of the personnel to carry out the activities  so there would be a lot of delays and imperfections in the work done. So to overcome this  computers were incorporated into the daily functioning of the institutions.

Originally built for internal agents   it was later enhanced to support external users  offering a seamless experience on d esktop  mobile  and tablet (iPad)  platforms. The redesign focused on creating a more intuitive and interactive interface while ensuring consistent  functionality across all devices. The system was built using Java  Spring MVC  Gradle  AngularJS  jQuery  and  FTL  with Oracle databases and both  REST and SOAP web services to connect smoothly with external systems. A modular design  clean coding standards   and automated testing with JUnit  HP ALM  and SonarQube helped ensure reliability and maintainability. Depl oyments  on Tomcat and WebLogic servers were carefully validated  keeping post-production issues to a minimum. Users benefited from faster  more responsive interfaces  and the system consistently handled transactions securely and  efficiently. The project‟s success was supported by strong collaboration across teams  structured delivery cycles  and  thoughtful attention to both technical and user experience considerations.

However  recently  many other ﬁelds of application have been recognized  particularly with the development of smart contracts. Among them is the possible application of blockchain technology in the domain of land administration  mostly as a tool for transparency in the developing countries and means to ﬁght corruption. However  developed countries also ﬁnd interest in launching pilot projects to test their applicability in land administration domain for reasons such as to increase the speed and reduce costs of the real property transactions through a more secure environment. In this paper  we analyse how transactions are handled in Serbian land administration and how this process may be supported by modern ledger technologies such as blockchain. In order to analyse how blockchain could be implemented to support transactions in land information systems (LIS)  it is necessary to understand cadastral processes and transactions in LIS  as well as legislative and organizational aspects of LIS. Transactions in cadastre comprise many actors and utilize both alphanumeric (descriptive or legal) data and geospatial data about property boundaries on the cadastral map. Based on the determined requirements for the blockchain- based LIS  we propose a system architecture for its implementation.,tps,strong,0.0023,1.0,1.0,0,0.3016

The amount of IoT devices is rapidly increasing. By 2025  forecasts suggest that there will be more than 75 billion IoT-connected devices in use  which is three times those deployed in 2019 (https://www.statista.com/statistics/471264/iot-number-of-connected- devices-worldwide/  (accessed on 28 March 2022)). The unprecedented amount of data collected by the IoT on the physical world  combined with cloud computing  promotes the development of new services  affecting many aspects of human daily life and with great market potential. Typical areas of application include manufacturing  smart city  supply chain  transportation  agriculture  energy management  environmental monitoring  and many others [16]. Lately  IoT devices have not only been exchanging data; an emerging trend is to enable Machine-to-Machine (M2M) payments  turning each connected device into a platform for selling and purchasing. By 2022  451 Research’s IoT Market Monitor expects that USD 7.5 billion in new transactions will be driven  in the US  through IoT payments (https://www. forbes.com/sites/jordanmckee/2019/10/09/the-internet-of-payments-has-arrived/?sh= 6faa22da3e69  (accessed on 28 March 2022)). A typical IoT architecture consists of things  gateways  and the cloud platform (see Figure 2) [ 17]. Usually  things support power-efﬁcient wireless technologies (e.g.  Lo- RaWAN [18]  Sigfox [19]) that  in order to limit the energy consumption and prolong the network lifetime  do not allow direct connection to the Internet. In this scenario  gateways are more powerful devices  usually not bounded by energy constraints  in charge of re- ceiving the wireless communications from the things and delivering the messages to the cloud platform over the Internet.,tps,weak,0.0022,1.0,1.0,0,0.3016

The relatively new emerging paradigms in various sciences  such as geometry (fractals)  physics (quantum)  and database systems (distributed ledger—blockchain)  seem to po- tentially contribute to a greater shift in the framework of the ﬁnance industry  bringing also some concerns (cyber-threats). Consistent and extensive investigation of the reasonable potential impact of these new models (and their underlying technologies) is performed  and then tested through a SWOT analysis  as the main objective of this research. Threats and opportunities are always intrinsically driven by the introduction of technological advancements (revolutions). This research conﬁrms that information availability and the increasing interconnection of crosswise applications of each discovery to the different ﬁelds of science is determining the rapid succession of revolutions identiﬁed by evident large shifts in economic paradigms. The growing computing capacity and the development of increasingly powerful predictive software are leading to a competitive  extremely dynamic  and challenging system. In this context  as shown by history  there is a high possibility of market concentration in which  however  only a few corporations—digital giants—can afford to develop these technologies  consolidating their dominance.

In essence  it includes  sensors that collect data from the physical  environment  like temperature or speed  and actuators  that perform actions in the real world  such as turning  on a motor or opening a valve. These components are  connected through a network that facilitates the flow  of information and commands. Controllers  which can  be either hardware or software  play a pivotal rol e by  processing the data from the sensors to make decisions  and then sending commands back to the actuators to  carry out actions. Human operators may also be part  of this system  monitoring and managing it by  interacting through the network. Overall  this ICPS  framework is fundamental to the functioning of smart  Cornell University         arxiv.org  3 devices  autonomous systems  and automated  processes in various industries. Industry Cyber - Physical Systems (ICPS) represent a blend of physical  processes  networked information technologies  and  computational intelligence [12]. This integration of  physical and digital worlds is enabling the  development of increasingly sophisticated and  interconnected systems that can operate with greater  autonomy  efficiency  and safety [13]. ICPS are built  upon physical processes  which are the fundamental  mechanisms by w hich matter  and energy are  transformed [14]. These processes can be as simple as  a valve opening or closing  or as complex as a  chemical reaction or a manufacturing operation. ICPS  must accurately model and control these physical  processes to achieve their desired outcomes [15]. ICPS  relies on networked information technologies to  exchange data and information between different  components of the system [16]. This includes sensors  that collect data about the physical world  actuators  that control physical d evices  and communication  networks that connect these components together. ICPS must effectively manage the flow of information  to ensure that the system operates in a coordinated and  synchronized manner. ICPS employs computational  intelligence to analyze data  make decisions  and adapt  to changing conditions [14].

Milestones in DeFi Development in the U.S. The evolution of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) in the United States is a testament to the dynamic interplay between  technological innovation and financial services. The journey of DeFi  from its nascent stages to becoming a significant  part of the financial landscape  is marked by several key milestones that reflect its growing impact and integration into  the broader economy. The early stages of DeFi's development coincided with the advent of blockchain technology and the introduction of  Bitcoin in 2008. However  it was the launch of Ethereum in 2015  with its groundbreaking smart contract capabilities   that truly set the stage for the DeFi revolution. The United States  known for its innovative spirit and technological  prowess  quickly emerged as a fertile  ground for the growth and development of DeFi applications. Protocols such as  MakerDAO  Compound  and Uniswap gained prominence  offering decentralized services like lending  borrowing  and  trading  which challenged traditional financial models by elimina ting intermediaries (Umarov  Umarov  & Umarov   2022). A pivotal moment in DeFi's journey was its increasing integration with traditional financial systems. Major financial  institutions in the U.S. began to recognize the potential of blockchain technology i n transforming finance. This  integration marked a shift in perception  positioning DeFi not just as an alternative but as a complementary component  of the broader financial ecosystem. This period saw significant investments from traditional financial entit ies into DeFi  projects  signaling a blending of the old with the new (Ozili  2022). Technological advancements and innovations have been at the heart of DeFi's growth in the U.S. Innovations such as  yield farming  liquidity mining  and the introduction of governance tokens have not only attracted a broader user base  but have also enhanced the functionality and efficiency of DeFi services. These innovations reflect the sector's  commitment to evolving and adapting to user needs and market dynamics (Umarov  Um arov  & Umarov  2022). The Ethereum Merge  which marked the transition of the Ethereum blockchain from proof -of-work (PoW) to proof-of- stake (PoS)  was another significant milestone for DeFi.,,weak,0.0022,1.0,1.0,0,0.3015

Study Instrument  A questionnaire (in Supplementary Information) was designed to collect data for this  study. The questionnaire was divided into two sections. In the first section  32 items were  used to measure the seven constructs presented in the proposed research model (Figure  2). The scales for PE  FC  ITR  UI  GR  and PR  were developed after a thorough review of  literature related to different IS models. Th e scale for FC  PE  and UI  was adopted by  Venkatesh et al. (2012). The initial trust scales were adapted from Kim and Garrison  (2009). The government regulation was measured using four items adapted from Tor- natzky et al. (1990). The perceived risk scale was adapted from von Solms and von Solms  (2018). All the scales were measured on a 5- point Likert scale. The second part of the  instrument was used to gather demographic information about the participant.  A pilot study was conducted before the actual study to improve the readability and  validity of the scale.

These websites provide Blockchain companies' listing  allowing researchers to extract vital information on innovative Blockchain solutions and token prices (Dal Mas  Massaro  et al.  2020; Felix & von Eije  2019). Previous researchers used both databases as a source of information (Felix & von Eije  2019). Considering the paper's research aim  the analysis discovered 432 companies on their Initial Coin Offering (ICO) in investments  entertainment  banking  exchange and launchpad  media  health  real estate  casino and gambling  and marketing categories. After this first step  the authors proceeded with the companies' selection considering only the top 25% of internal evaluations pro- vided by the same database. Then  the authors moved to the analysis of each extracted company's related website and white paper. The second company screening step started with the analysis of companies that had to include sustainability as a vital element of their business strategy and value proposition  adopting the research frame- work of Biloslavo et al. ( 2018) and Bocken et al. ( 2019). Therefore  the second investigation process looked for companies active in Technological groups with material maximization and energy effi- ciency  value creation from waste  substitution with renewables and natural processes; Social groups with delivering functionality rather than ownership  stewardship role adoption  sufficiency encourage; and Organizational groups with repurposing actions for society/ environment and developing scale-up solutions.

Case study,15,LHSBHPMK,"Decentralized Finance (DEFI) in the U. S. economy: A review: Assessing the rise, challenges, and implications of blockchain-driven financial systems.",2024,Conclusion,The study has revealed several key discoveries in the realm of Decentralized Finance (DeFi). DeFi has emerged as a  transformative force in the financial sector  characterized by its decentralized nature  reliance on blockchain technology   and the use of smart contracts. It has shown potential in enhancing financial inclusion  offering innovative financial  products  and challenging traditional financial models. However  DeFi also faces significant ch allenges  including  regulatory uncertainty  security vulnerabilities  and scalability issues. The future landscape of DeFi presents a mix of opportunities and challenges. On the one hand  DeFi is poised for further  growth and innovation  potentially integr ating more deeply with traditional financial systems and expanding its range  of services. On the other hand  it must navigate complex regulatory environments  ensure robust security measures  and  address scalability to sustain this growth. The evolution of  DeFi will likely continue to be driven by technological  advancements  changing regulatory landscapes  and the shifting needs of its user base. World Journal of Advanced Research and Reviews  2024  21(01)  2313–2328  2327  In the context of the evolving landscape of Decentralized Finance (DeFi)  this study offers several recommendations for  industry stakeholders and policymakers. Firstly  there is a pressing need for the development of clear and  comprehensive regulatory frameworks. Such frameworks should protect consumers and ensure financial stability while  fostering innovation withi n the DeFi sector. Enhancing security protocols is also crucial  as it will protect against  vulnerabilities and build trust among users in the DeFi ecosystem.,scalability; security,medium,0.0026,1.2,1.0,0,0.3418

Accordingly  the maximum score for a primary study is 4. 3 Assessment process definition . In this aspect  authors identify/assess if the paper introduces a way to assess the applicability of blockchain in a given situation. 4 Blockchain adoption process . Apart from the assessment process  this aspect reflects if the paper is providing information on the adoption process to guide organizations to embrace blockchain-based solutions. Despite that the focus of the paper is not the adoption process  authors want to investigate to what extent the proposal presented in the analyzed paper goes beyond selection and includes further aspects  in this case adoption process. Although adoption is a process that goes beyond selection  it is a key factor in technology acceptance. 49 5 Blockchain waves included in the initiative . The paper included aspects on Blockchain 1.0  Blockchain 2.0  and Blockchain 3.0 as different options for implementation. Blockchain 4.0 is not considered in the study performed. The possible scores are: yes  somehow  and no. These four aspects were selected after reading the set of nine papers and adapting the aims of the research. From Table 1  one can see that although there are works devoted to specific environments  the applicability of the framework is broad in most of the efforts. In fact  five out of nine works are published in 2019.

This is a threat deeply connected with researcher bias. In our case  two researchers with experience in secondary studies participated in the process  and the other researcher reviewed results and conclusions. The descriptive validity is the extent to which observations are described in an accurate and objective way. Mapping was performed by means of a form to support the recording of data and to trace aspects inside the different proposals analyzed. Theoretical validity discusses threats in building theory out of the observed phenomenon. While it is true that this work is not covering the entire research published in the topic  this subset is an acceptable sample for the mapping conducted. Another aspect to take into account is researcher bias in the phases of selection and extraction of data. To reduce this threat  authors followed a process to involve all researchers in the mapping and measure their agreements by means of the Krippendorff alpha statistic to test agreement among them. The agreement reached between first and second authors was 68.71% being ideal values around 80% of agreement. If any disagreements exist between the two authors,tps,strong,0.0024,1.2,1.0,0,0.3417

Third  BT is expected to have significant shifts in the accounting paradigm and practice; many countries have developed strategies and started to adopt BT in accounting practices. Specifically  most North American and European banks are exploring adopting BT in the payment field (Matskiv et al.  2023; Abreu et al.  2018; Chang et al.  2020)  and many countries in the MENA (e.g. UAE) region are developing strategies and infrastructure to adopt BT JHASS 5 4 360 Downloaded from http://www.emerald.com/jhass/article-pdf/5/4/359/1505653/jhass-06-2023-0072.pdf by guest on 03 February 2026 (Papadaki and Karamitsos  2021 ). Also  many logistics organizations (e.g. DHL) in many industries have adopted BT in the last three years ( DHL  2022)  and since it is a global world and all organizations are connected to do business  Egyptian organizations and financial institutions will eventually have to adopt BT. Therefore  Egypt is collaborating with BT service suppliers to provide Ethereum [1] BT services in Egypt ( Bartlett  2022). Furthermore  the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) developed an initiative to introduce BT in the remittance market  which holds the fifth-highest position in the global remittance market rankings ( Papadaki and Karamitsos  2021 ). Also  the CBE initiated a project called“Block Banking” in 2019 to adopt the BT in the banking and financial sector and support financial inclusion in Egypt. At least two commercial banks have implemented BT in remittance ( Ahram online  2023 ). Additionally  some startups are developing a blockchain-based accounting platform for accounting and auditing processes and transactions ( Ahram online  2023 ). Therefore  the accounting and auditing profession and regulatory bodies must be prepared to deal with the technology when BT is fully adopted in the business world ( Cusack  2018; Hashem et al.  2023). 2.

Case study,19,4EQA89WU,The Evolution of Payment Systems in Bangladesh: Transition from Traditional Banking to Blockchain based Transactions,2024,Introduction,Bangladesh's financial system has changed a lot in the  last ten years. New modern transaction tools are part of the  banking system  and people now have diverse ranges of  choices  from offline transactions to online transactions. This  shift shows a worldwide move towards a digital payment  system instead of conventional banking practices. People now  use digital payments and blockchain technology more than in  the past. The inclination of Bangladesh toward faster  safer  financial transactions provides a compelling example of how  new technology like blockchain cryptocurrency is remaking  the financial landscape in nations striving to grow their  economy. This study closely studies the changing financial  system  looking at different facets of Bangladesh’s financial  transformation  from traditional banking  which is very slow  to reach every corner of the country  to new digital  robust  ways of online banking that let more people take part without  the need to be worried about safe  and security. Blockchain  technology ushers a new era of safer  transparent  enhanced   and more secure financial transactions  making Bangladesh a  leader in the rapid financial evolution. The study explores the sentiment of the people toward  adopting new financial technologies in Bangladesh. It  considered data from a wide range of respondents using  various analyses such as statistics  models  and sentiment  analysis.

The study’s conclusions may be less transferable to other locations with different governmental frameworks  cultural attitudes  and technological infrastructures due to the study’s exclusive emphasis on the United Kingdom and United States. The study’s findings may not be representative of the wide range of situations and points of view found in nations with varying degrees of Bitcoin adoption. The sources and methods utilized to collect the data included in this analysis  including adoption rates  volatility indexes  and regulatory approaches  all contribute to its accuracy and dependability. The validity of the study’s findings may be compromised by inconsistencies in data quality and the presence of possible biases in data collection. Maintaining accurate data is difficult due to the fast-paced nature of technological development and legislative changes in the Bitcoin and blockchain field. The study’s conclusions  suggestions  and future directions may be greatly affected by the introduction of new technologies  the emergence of new use cases  and the development of new legislation. The research may have overlooked important ethical  social  and environmental concerns related to cryptocurrency and blockchain technology due to its heavy emphasis on technical  financial  and legal factors.

EthernityDB [38] can be used to integrate database functionalities in Ethereum blockchai n [24] by modularizing the Ethereum smart contracts. EthernityDB uses MongoDB for the coupling with Ethereum blockchain. CouchDB [7] is a key-value data store and provides rich query capability similar to MongoDB. Hyperledger Fabric [6 ] uses CouchDB as a state database for storing chaincode processed transaction data as key-value pairs. It supports rich queries against chaincode data. Hyperledger Composer also uses CouchDB by converting SQL queries into CouchDB JSON queries. QLDB Amazon QLDB [39] is a ledger database that abstracts many features of blockchain. It renders a tamper- resistant  transparent  and cryptographically veriﬁable ledger of transactions. QLDB lacks decentralization and hence doe s not follow any consensus algorithm.

Everex partners with banks targeting underbanked populations and allows workers to send money home without paying high remittance fees. Merchants must be partnered with SureRemit and accept tokens. Everex needs to have licensed exchange partners in the country of receipt to exchange tokens into local currency. Cost of Compliance Among Different Regulatory Environments SureRemit leverages the Stellar platform and also acquires partner merchants to bypass different regulatory environments altogether by settling Remit tokens with ﬁat currency via Stellar. - The Token can only be used to make purchases with partner merchants. Therefore  the money cannot be used if a partner merchant does not accept the Remit token. - Interoperability SureRemit has standardized the process regardless of country. The same information is required no matter where or with whom the transaction is placed. Everex has trusted banking partners in the countries they interact with  thus promising a 1:1 conversion rate of their eFiat stablecoins. - For the stable coins to be redeemed in Fiat currency  Everex must have local banking partners that operate within that currency. Otherwise  the eFiat cannot be sent/redeemed. Risk RemitToken is not subject to the volatility of currency exchange rates. Immediate and continuous liquidity provided by Stellar allows for the issuance and trading of tokens immediately. Therefore  they are not subject to the risk of exchange rates. The Everex Token is a dollar-pegged stablecoin  ensuring that the money being transferred is equivalent to the same ﬁat currency that is being transferred.

Interoperability,5,SUHXIEJV,Solutions to Scalability of Blockchain: A Survey,2020,Methodology,US Hybrid Consensus is a protocol that combines some classical consensus protocols. ByzCoin [25] proposes a two-phase protocol based on the idea of Bitcoin-NG [15]. However  it is able to ensure strong consistency by combining PoW and PBFT. In addition  ByzCoin uses a collective signing protocol called Cosi [71] to reduce the cost of the prepare and commit phases of PBFT and scale it to large consensus groups. Later works such as Hybrid consensus [72]  Solidus [73] also propose to combine different protocols with PoW aiming to improve on the throughput and security. Algorand [16] is a cryptocurrency based on a Byzantine Agreement (BA) protocol. By combining with V eriﬁable Random Functions [74]  users are chosen to become a com- mittee member to participate in the BA and reach consensus on the next set of transactions. To mitigate targeted attacks  the participant will be replaced after sending a message in BA. With all these approaches  Algorand scales to 500 000 users in experiments and achieves high throughput. f: OTHER CONSENSUS Some other new consensus algorithms have been proposed in recent years  including PoA (proof-of-authority) [75]  PoC (proof of capacity) [76] and PoP (proof-of-Participation) [77]  which make some modiﬁcations of the previous con- sensus to improve the scalability of blockchain. PoP (Proof of Participation) is a new protocol that imple- ments PoS through the mining mechanism of PoW. PoP selects a list of stakeholders to work out a computational task  which is simpler than that in PoW  to generate a new block. Other stakeholders who did not participate in the mining validate the block and propagate it. Unlike PoS  transaction fees in PoP are only distributed to stakeholders participat- ing in validation and propagation  which thus encourages stakeholders to maintain an online node and sustain the sys- tem. PoP includes two layers of security  proof-of-work  and proof-of-stake  that protect the system from security prob- lems (e.g. double-spending) and also consume less energy than the traditional PoW mechanism. PoC (Proof of Capacity) is a consensus algorithm that uti- lizes the storage resource (disk space) to mine.,throughput; scalability; security; consistency,medium,0.0025,1.3,1.0,0,0.3617

RS_ChangeList class representing a list of changes in LIS and its relations. ISPRS Int. J. Geo-Inf. 2021  10  35 10 of 22 The process of conducting changes in LIS basically relies on a single database table. However  implementing the history of changes has been proved to be a complex and error-prone task  with the examples of deliberate changes in the database tables [58]. This creates the opportunity and gives the motivation to secure such records on a blockchain. Furthermore  the mentioned table is append-only which means that apart from inserting new rows no other operations  such as update or delete  should be allowed. This is in line with the blockchain transaction recording capabilities. The main privacy issue related to transactions in LIS that has been witnessed in previous years is that the database containing transactions data can be compromised. There have been reported cases of deliberate or non-deliberate errors in the table of changes that might cause problems. Therefore  a lot of paper documents are kept supporting the integrity of data saved in the database. Blockchain may increase overall conﬁdence in the system. LIS data is public for reading except for personally sensitive information or details about restrictions (such as the value of a mortgage or creditor)  but only selected users can modify data in it according to the assigned roles and privileges. At this point  these are selected employees of the cadastre in charge of these activities. 4. Requirements for Blockchain-Based LIS In order to establish blockchain-based LIS  key requirements should be addressed to launch a blockchain-based cadastral system. This includes: • Analysis whether blockchain network should be public or private and authorised and how identity management will be handled. • What data will comprise one transaction in a blockchain. • How smart contracts will be used and what business logic should be implemented and executed on a blockchain. 4.1.

Vechainthor is an enhanced version of Blockchain. It is forked and improved based on  the Ethereum codebase. The following are the enhancements:  1. Tx format includes three new fields: ID  DependsOn  Blockref  and Expiration ;  2. Each Tx has its own ID; thereby  the application deals with a single Tx instead of a Tx bundle of Txs ;  3. Blockref delivers additional information about the previous  current  and next block. Also  it gives info about Tx  creation time. It will be helpful for financial purposes in case of acceptance delay  for example ;  4. Expiration is added to the Tx to avoid stacking for a long time. In addition  a Tx can do additional POW to speed  up the validation time (it can consume more to track miners' attention  but the extra pow will compensate its  loss);  5. Multi-task transaction: a Tx is composed of many small Txs to address the complex business payments. Vechain  uses Proof of Authority ""POA"" as a consensus algorithm that considers both stake and reputation. The maximum Tx speed announced is 10k Tx per second. As future work  they are looking for involving side chains  to enhance the scalability of  the vechain system. Vechainthor introduces the new multilayer payment model to ensure  the token stability price. Two tokens are utili zed to fulfill the Tx process: VET and VTHO. VET is the main token or""  smart money"" that represents the amounts been held by users. VET generates VTHO to cover the cost of smart contracts  and Tx payments. Using this payment method will stabilize the cost of the token. Vechain uses Reed -Solomon (RS)  algorithm to shard objects into many parts  and then it reconstructs the data reliably from the remaining drives.",scalability,strong,0.0024,1.3,1.0,0,0.3617

As illustrated in Figure 2  it  is composed of parent chain and sub -chains with cryptocurrency named WTC  running and mined on the parent chain. A sub -chain is working separately after being created and registered inside the  parent chain. The parent ledger contains only detailed informat ion related to the sub -chains. Each sub -chain has its  ledger and can be created and registered any time under the parent chain network. Parent chain consensus is a  combination of POW  POS  and POL. Besides  its block creation time is 60 seconds. Its ledger  size is not affected by  the number of sub-chains since the parent chain runs independently of sub -chains. Thus  the parent chain is considered  scalable and secure. In addition  the smart contract is the foundation of waltonchain that builds and maintains the  underlying logic platform. The waltonchain block contains up to 255 Tx records. It is made up of Block’ depth and timestamp  block identity   block account ID and public key  the identity of the previous block and the hash value  the total number of tokens of the  Txs contained in the block and byte fee  the Tx information contained in the block  Block payload length and payload  hash value  The generated signature of the block  Accumulated coinage difficulty of the block.

Trading platforms Gochain and Menlo one are now using PoR. Because a ﬁxed group of validators mining  the PoAuthority  and PoR algorithms make the blockchain network less decentralized  furthermore  they have not been thoroughly tested for performance and security issues [12]  [27]  [28]. E. DECENTRALIZED FINANCE DEFI AND SMART CONTRACTS Decentralized ﬁnance (DeFi) is a Blockchain-based ﬁnancial infrastructure that has recently grown in popularity. The term refers to a set of protocols established on open  unlicensed  and highly interoperable public smart contract systems  such as the Ethereum blockchain [6]  [18]. Traditional ﬁnancial services have been updated to be more open and transparent. The problem  in particular  does not rely on centralized orga- nizations or intermediaries. Instead  decentralized applica- tions and open protocols are used (DApps). The code ensures that agreements are followed  that transactions are safe and secure  and that allowed status changes are recorded on a public blockchain. As a result  this architecture can create an irreversible and highly interoperable ﬁnancial system with unparalleled transparency  equal access rights  and little need for custodians  central clearinghouses  or escrow services because ‘‘smart contracts’’ can handle the majority of these functions. DeFi uses a multi-layered architecture. Every layer has a distinct role. The layers are built on top of each other  resulting in an open and highly composable infrastructure that anyone can build on  rehash  or use. Here are the different layers of the DeFi stack [21]  [6]  for example: - The settlement layer allows the network to securely store ownership data and guarantees that any state changes adhere to its set of rules. - The asset layer: This category includes all assets issued on top of the settlement layer. This includes the native protocol asset as well as any other assets that have been issued on this Blockchain (usually referred to as tokens). - The protocol layer: The standards cover speciﬁc use cases such as decentralized exchanges  debt markets  derivatives  and on-chain asset management. These standards are commonly implemented as a set of open-access smart contracts (or DeFi applications).,security,weak,0.0028,1.2,1.0,0,0.3419

FinTech  the combination of  technology and financial services [13  p.3; 14]  has become  a well-discussed area of study in the new era of the busi- ness industry. FinTech companies offer many services  such  as digital cash  cognitive systems  and distributed ledger  technology. Traditional financial organizations and start-up  companies are increasingly partnering with FinTech [15] to  provide user-friendly and cost-effective financial electronic  services. Blockchain is a common FinTech that transforms  how financial businesses operate  collaborate  and transact  with their stakeholders [16]. This suggests that the decentral- ized financial network is bringing about a major financial  sector revolution with the enhancement of digital wallets as a  crucial component of financial inclusion. The decentralized  electronic ledger system will transform the way transactions  are carried out  changing the shape and size of the financial  sector. Studies [1   17] have demonstrated that research on  blockchain applications can save business money and open  up new commercial and export opportunities  both of which  will expand in the near future.,,medium,0.0026,1.2,1.0,0,0.3418

S. economy: A review: Assessing the rise, challenges, and implications of blockchain-driven financial systems.",2024,Introduction,1.1. Unveiling the Concept of Decentralized Finance (DeFi).  Decentralized Finance (DeFi) represents a paradigm shift in the financial sector  moving away from traditional   centralized systems towards a more open  transparent  and accessible framework. This innovative concept  primarily  built on the Ethereum platform  offers an alternative to conventional financial infrastructure  leveraging blockchain  technology to democratize financial services (Umarov  Umarov  & Umarov  2022). World Journal of Advanced Research and Reviews  2024  21(01)  2313–2328  2314  At its core  DeFi is a system where financial products become available on a public decentralized blockchain network   making them open to anyone to use  rather than going through intermediaries like banks or brokerages (dos Santos et  al.  2022). Unlike traditional finance  DeFi is characterized by its open -source nature  immutable transactions  and lack  of centralized control. This means that DeFi platforms operate without a central authority  using smart contracts - self- executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code. The emergence of DeFi can be traced back to the development of blockchain technology and the introduction of Bitcoin  in 2008  which laid the foundation for decentralized financial systems. However  it was the launch of Ethereum in 2015   a Turing -complete blockchain that significantl y expanded the scope of blockchain -based financial systems beyond  simple cryptocurrency transactions (dos Santos et al.  2022). Ethereum's introduction of smart contracts enabled the  creation of more complex financial services  such as lending  borrowing  and yield farming  all operating in a trustless  environment. DeFi's growth has been meteoric  with the total value locked (TVL) in DeFi protocols surging from a mere $4 billion to  over $100 billion in just a few years  reflecting its increasing popularity and the growing trust in its underlying  technology (Jensen  von Wachter  & Ross  2021). This explosive growth can be attributed to several factors  including  the transparency of blockchain technology  the potential for higher returns compared to traditiona l banking  and the  inclusivity and accessibility of DeFi platforms. One of the most significant advantages of DeFi is its potential to offer financial services to the unbanked and  underbanked populations.,,weak,0.0024,1.2,1.0,0,0.3417
Interoperability,14,95TMJST6,Blockchain as IoT Economy Enabler: A Review of Architectural Aspects,2022,Introduction,The Internet of Things (IoT) is a network of tiny devices connected over the Internet to observe the physical world  gather data  and consciously act on it in a useful way. Billions of connected IoT devices are expected to bring a substantial added value for communities and for individuals  also in view of the fact that IoT is tightly connected with several well-known trends  such as Big Data  smart cities  and Industry 4.0  which promise to deeply change many aspects of our lives in the future. As an example  the unprecedented amount of data gathered by billions of IoT sensors will bring us the ability to get new insights and actionable intelligence regarding our world [1 2]. The pervasive presence of smart connected devices will enable the development of innovative services to improve our lives [3] and to face new and unexpected challenges  such as the COVID-19 outbreak [4]  and private and public objects (i.e.  things) will be available to anyone for renting  even for a short time  to support a new form of shared economy [5]. The general problem of giving a reward to subjects that contribute to this novel added value ecosystem is not only an economic or business-related question. Many IoT applications are peculiar regarding the amount of involved users  the volume and diversity of generated data  the frequency of economic transactions and their latency constraints  J. Sens.

Hence  related technical and architectural aspects are by themselves an interesting cross-cutting dimension for many IoT applications. This is even more compelling if we observe that decentralization is going to be a fundamental aspect of evolved IoT ecosystems. In fact  a single organization handling a vast amount of heterogeneous and pervasive IoT devices is not simply unrealistic  but also unfeasible. We expect that in the more complex scenarios  many organizations will contribute to a single IoT ecosystem. Furthermore  the pervasive nature of IoT deployments usually requires the involvement of end-users that buy  deploy  and contribute their devices to an ecosystem on the basis of some kind of future advantage. Ecosystems of this kind grow as more people are willing to contribute  and not (only) under the pressure of centralized investments.,latency; tps; security,weak,0.0024,1.2,1.0,0,0.3417

As a forerunner of public BoBs  Polkadot [130] standardizes the method for passing mes- sages between parallel chains of homogenous relay networks. It acknowledges the interoperabil- ity of parallel chains  which may engage in cross-chain interactions to reinforce the performance of one another. A standard created by Polkadot 2.0 called XCM [17] enables protocol design- ers to specify the types of data and sources from which their chains can send and receive data. It comes with one virtual machine that enables flexible execution and one virtual machine al- lows for adaptable execution. Another pioneer in the BoBs ecosystem is Cosmos. According to the IBC [67]  Cosmos is an end-to-end  connection-oriented  stateful protocol used to provide authenticated  reliable communication across diverse blockchains arranged in a dynamic topol- ogy. These advancements in the Polkadot ecosystem enhance the versatility and e fficiency of cross-chain communication and execution  ultimately contributing to the broader development of blockchain technology. Chainlink created CCIP [32]  focusing on end-to-end security  futur- istic interoperability  and an easy development process.

Milestones in DeFi Development in the U.S. The evolution of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) in the United States is a testament to the dynamic interplay between  technological innovation and financial services. The journey of DeFi  from its nascent stages to becoming a significant  part of the financial landscape  is marked by several key milestones that reflect its growing impact and integration into  the broader economy. The early stages of DeFi's development coincided with the advent of blockchain technology and the introduction of  Bitcoin in 2008. However  it was the launch of Ethereum in 2015  with its groundbreaking smart contract capabilities   that truly set the stage for the DeFi revolution. The United States  known for its innovative spirit and technological  prowess  quickly emerged as a fertile  ground for the growth and development of DeFi applications. Protocols such as  MakerDAO  Compound  and Uniswap gained prominence  offering decentralized services like lending  borrowing  and  trading  which challenged traditional financial models by elimina ting intermediaries (Umarov  Umarov  & Umarov   2022). A pivotal moment in DeFi's journey was its increasing integration with traditional financial systems. Major financial  institutions in the U.S. began to recognize the potential of blockchain technology i n transforming finance. This  integration marked a shift in perception  positioning DeFi not just as an alternative but as a complementary component  of the broader financial ecosystem. This period saw significant investments from traditional financial entit ies into DeFi  projects  signaling a blending of the old with the new (Ozili  2022). Technological advancements and innovations have been at the heart of DeFi's growth in the U.S. Innovations such as  yield farming  liquidity mining  and the introduction of governance tokens have not only attracted a broader user base  but have also enhanced the functionality and efficiency of DeFi services. These innovations reflect the sector's  commitment to evolving and adapting to user needs and market dynamics (Umarov  Um arov  & Umarov  2022). The Ethereum Merge  which marked the transition of the Ethereum blockchain from proof -of-work (PoW) to proof-of- stake (PoS)  was another significant milestone for DeFi.,,weak,0.0026,1.0,1.0,0,0.3018

Originally built for internal agents   it was later enhanced to support external users  offering a seamless experience on d esktop  mobile  and tablet (iPad)  platforms. The redesign focused on creating a more intuitive and interactive interface while ensuring consistent  functionality across all devices. The system was built using Java  Spring MVC  Gradle  AngularJS  jQuery  and  FTL  with Oracle databases and both  REST and SOAP web services to connect smoothly with external systems. A modular design  clean coding standards   and automated testing with JUnit  HP ALM  and SonarQube helped ensure reliability and maintainability. Depl oyments  on Tomcat and WebLogic servers were carefully validated  keeping post-production issues to a minimum. Users benefited from faster  more responsive interfaces  and the system consistently handled transactions securely and  efficiently. The project‟s success was supported by strong collaboration across teams  structured delivery cycles  and  thoughtful attention to both technical and user experience considerations.

In this scenario  gateways are more powerful devices  usually not bounded by energy constraints  in charge of re- ceiving the wireless communications from the things and delivering the messages to the cloud platform over the Internet.,tps,weak,0.0024,1.0,1.0,0,0.3017

Artificial Intelligence (AI) for Blockchain Scalability  AI can play a crucial role in enhancing blockchain scalability by optimizing network  performance  enabling predictive sc aling  and improving consensus algorithms. Some  specific applications of AI include:  ● Predictive Load Balancing:  AI algorithms can predict transaction traffic  patterns and optimize the allocation of resources across the blockchain network. By anticipating p eriods of high demand  AI can dynamically adjust resource  allocation  ensuring the network can scale effectively without overloading nodes. ● Intelligent Consensus Mechanisms:  AI could be employed to improve  consensus algorithms  making them more efficient a nd adaptable to changing  network conditions. For example  machine learning techniques could be used to  analyze network performance and adjust parameters of consensus protocols like  Proof-of-Work or Proof-of-Stake to improve throughput and minimize latency. ● Automated Fraud Detection: AI can help detect and prevent malicious activity  by analyzing transaction patterns and identifying anomalies that could indicate  fraud. This contributes to enhancing the security and reliability of blockchain  systems as they scale.,throughput; latency; scalability; security,weak,0.003,1.4,1.0,0,0.3821

Moreover  systems integration supports scalability by  allowing organizations to add new functionalities and services without overhauling existing  systems. For example  integrating new payment methods or financial services can be  achieved with minimal disruption to existing operations (Cooper  2017  Huang et al.  2021) . This scalability is crucial for FinTech companies that need to adapt quickly to evolving  market demands and technological advancements.

Process automation tools can handle tasks such as data entry and  reconciliation  which traditionally require significant human effort  thereby improving speed  and accuracy. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning also play a significant role in enhancing  efficiency through decision -making automation. AI -driven systems can analyze transaction  patterns  detect anomalies  and make real-time decisions that optimize transaction processing  and fraud detection (Liu et al.  2020). For example  AI algorithms can identify suspicious  activities and flag potential fraudulent transactions  reducing the need for manual review and  increasing the overall efficiency of transaction processing. Security is a paramount concern in  systems integration  especially in the financial sector (Goodfellow  Bengio & Courville   2016  Srivastava & Jain  2017). Integrating robust cybersecurity measures wi thin the  transaction workflow is essential to protect sensitive financial data and maintain trust.

B. DETAILED INSIGHTS FROM THE STUDY The FRAUD-X Synergy model consistently demonstrates superior performance across key metrics  as evidenced by the detailed analysis of results. Tables 1 and 2 compare the performance of FRAUD-X Synergy with Single-Plane AI models across the Credit Card Fraud (CC) and PaySim datasets. FRAUD-X achieves an F1 score of 85.9% on the CC dataset and 94.3% on PaySim  surpassing Single-Plane AI by approximately 4%. This improvement is corroborated by ROC curve analysis inFigures 2 and 3  where the FRAUD-X pipeline achieves near-perfect AUC values (∼0.99) compared to Single-Plane AI ( ∼0.97). These results highlight the syn- ergy’s enhanced ability to differentiate between legitimate and fraudulent transactions with higher precision and recall. Operational efficiency  as outlined in Tables 3 and 8  fur- ther validates FRAUD-X’s practicality. The system achieves an average inference time of 15.6 milliseconds per trans- action with a CPU usage of only 33%  making it feasible for real-time BFSI operations. This low overhead ensures scalability for mid-scale markets like North Macedonia. Moreover  Table 7 emphasizes FRAUD-X’s superior perfor- mance in zero-day infiltration scenarios  maintaining ∼90% recall compared to ∼75–80% for Single-Plane AI.

Scalability and Resourc e Efficiency:  Scalability is crucial for FinTech blockchain  applications. The fast surge in transaction volume strains traditional blockchain  infrastructures. Researchers found that sharding  which divides the blockchain into  smaller  manageable portions t hat can execute transactions simultaneously  may  improve scalability. Financial organizations may also benefit from hybrid blockchain  solutions that blend public and private blockchain capabilities for enhanced  scalability and flexibility. Resource efficiency is another important discovery. PoS and  other energy -efficient consensus processes reflect FinTech's rising sustainability  focus. These techniques cut operating costs and environmental effects  making  blockchain a better financial application alternative. Interoperability and Integration Challenges:  The results conclude that interoperability is  crucial to integrating blockchain technology into FinTech systems. Many financial  organizations need help integrating blockchain technology with old systems and  regulations. APIs and middleware that improve interoperability will allow  blockchain to integrate with older systems. This investigation found that blockchain technology improves FinTech database security but  challenges performance  scalability  and integration. For blockchain to reach its full potential  in finance  blockchain solutions must evolve along with interoperability and consensus  methods.

Techniques like pruning  compression  and sharding are essential for achieving this. Off-chain solutions and incentive systems also enhance efficiency. Balancing scalability  secu- rity  and decentralization is crucial for maximizing storage effectiveness [69]  [70]  [71]. V. PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS Existing works have been reviewed in Section III. This section refers to a thorough investigation of Section III. The study of this section provides a clear sense of the advantages and disadvantages of existing work having specific parameters  as defined in Section IV. A. KYC RELATED EXISTING WORKS Considering system complexity  [24]  banks have integrated Blockchain into their system to reduce privacy violations and ensure transparent user data. Data sharing accessibility allows one bank to access another’s data with limitations  and private information is shared according to users’ requirements for service. Smart contracts of Blockchain eliminate third parties and ensure privacy. On the other hand  KYC confirms the identity of financial institutions associated with the system. The IPFS protocol and Gpg4win in the Kleopatra platform can be used to maintain privacy. The verification system confirms the encryption mechanism for verifying customer documents and uploading verified documents to the IPFS network. Once the information is verified  private keys make data visible without the repetitive hassle. Anonymity makes data visible in the system without exposing information. In contrast  the system’s Pseudonymity makes the transaction process anonymous in the stage when it is necessary. The lightweight solution feature ensures data transactions without compromising privacy. Additionally  off-chain technology ensures external data is shared with concern. In a bank  various types of transactions occur  and end users need a clear understanding of them. Blockchain technology is transparent and requires a high demand in society; trans- actions may have user-centric accountability. The banking system’s immutability feature keeps data transparent with transaction history.,scalability,medium,0.0026,1.3,1.0,0,0.3618

This improvement underscores the advantage of integrating multiple modalities  especially in addressing the challenges posed by class imbalance in fraud detection datasets. The synergy pipeline excels in balancing precision and recall  critical for real-world BFSI applications where minimizing both false positives and false negatives is essential. I. OVERHEAD AND OPERATIONAL FEASIBILITY Table 8 presents the computational overhead of the FRAUD-X Synergy framework  detailing resource usage across its four core modules: AI-based anomaly detection  blockchain verification  cybersecurity tools  and early warn- ing integration. The AI module  utilizing a deep neural network (DNN)  accounts for the highest CPU and GPU consumption  requiring 15% of CPU resources and 400MB of GPU memory  with an inference time of 7.5 milliseconds per transaction. Blockchain verification  essential for ensuring transaction immutability  contributes to an additional 10% CPU usage  300MB of GPU memory  and a processing time of 4.1 milliseconds per transaction. Cybersecurity tools  which monitor network activity and intrusion attempts  add a modest 5% CPU load  200MB of GPU memory usage  and an inference delay of 2.2 milliseconds.At ∼15.6 ms/transaction  synergy remains within near-real-time BFSI demands.

The Blockchain-Based Hyperledger Fabric Network sys- tem complexity for KYC Optimization [16] has multiple sectors. Financial institutions must maintain the system complexity for transactional procedures for various purposes. Financial institutions focus on technical difficulties and challenges by identifying system complexity. Financial institutions use Smart Contracts for securely executing trans- actions without relying on third parties. Besides  data sharing and access control advantages with limited data shares and user control. As a result  users partially access data with the concern. Sometimes off-chain helps transactions execute externally securely in terms of money laundering. Financial statements are highly confidential. In this case  a lightweight solution provides a transaction facility without compromising privacy. Although all information is not user-centric in the financial category  they have limited accessibility to see a demo of the execution process from the user end. Anonymity offers transactions in the network hiding user information  and Pseudonymity offers a state to maintain users’ information private in the whole network. Regarding KYC optimization  Immutability helps keep data unalterable so that financial statements have authenticity over the network. Besides  significant changes in financial statements require a 51 percent stake in the whole network. The system provides privacy over the system with safer and faster bank transactions. Financial insertion in a node requires authenticity and has to be proven through the validators. Having the facility of accountability  customers of a bank have the right of accountability to the bank. Confidentiality of user data is required. In this case  a bank must maintain confidentiality to achieve a few services  such as vehicle insurance.

The table below  summarizes key improvements: Table 1: System Performance Comparison between Legacy Platform and MICTS Criterion Legacy System MICTS (Proposed) Improvement (%)  Avg. Latency (ms) 420 180 +57.1%  Throughput (Contracts/Min) 240 520 +116.7%  Error Rate (%) 3.2 0.9 –71.8%  The performance evaluation makes it very clear that the Multi -Interface Contract Transfer System (MICTS) has made  significant progress over the legacy platform. One of the greatest improvements is the decrease in average system  latency which reduced to 180 ms  compared to 420 ms  which is a 57.1 per cent improvement. Such decrease shows a  faster loading of pages  faster validations  and transaction processing  making the work of all interfaces more user - friendly. The system‟s performance was significantly improved  allowing it to handle high volumes of transactions reliably  across multiple interfaces. This ensures that both internal and external users can complete contract -to-contract transfers  efficiently  even under heavy usage  making the platform well -suited for large -scale financial operations where  responsiveness and concurrency are critical. The total error margin was also reduced by 3.2 to 0.9 percent  which means that the system reliabil ity increased by 71.8  percent. This minimization is caused by optimised service coordination  better exception handling  and enhanced  validation mechanisms which have been put in place at MICTS. Combining these measures  it can be concluded that MICTS prov ides a high -performing  resilient  and scalable  platform that can facilitate high and intensive operations in contract transfer.

Blockchain-based mobile charger billing system [40] has the system complexity of whom to share data and whom to not. System complexity gives the best requirements analysis for executing the system and which angle might give the best result. The system is facilitated with data sharing and access control over the system. The system is user decentralized  with access to a group of people that ensure security. Additionally  the system removes the third party  reducing the unnecessary verification cost between users and the billing procedure. Off-chain facilities offer external transaction facilities to a group of people without compromising any privacy that is absent in the system. As a result  the system information is available and public to the network. In the billing system  where the vehicle is charged is hardly identifiable. The presence of the feature is challenging and has technical difficulties. Pseudonymity is vital in this situation. Anonymity offers the billing transactions anonymous. Additionally  immutability requires data unalterable. Blockchain technology is more secure and safe. The system gives the advantages of it. The billing transaction is transparent  which makes the system trustworthy. Authenticity gives trustworthiness and reliability to the billing system. Absent accountability removes the questionable medium that has control over the user’s private key. The system does not maintain confidentiality due to not necessity of a third party. The integration of Blockchain technology provides availability and scalability in the system. Availability ensures data after verification in the network.

However  it is important to note that as a conceptual framework  specific efficiency metrics such as runtime  memory consumption  or energy usage cannot be quantified without full implementation and testing. Instead  the efficiency of the BFS system can be discussed in terms of process streamlining and data accessibility. For instance  the dual-blockchain approach potentially improves efficiency in data pro- cessing by separating public and private information flows  reducing the computational overhead typically associated with processing all data on a single blockchain. The real-time validation capability of the BFS system could enhance transactional efficiency by reducing the time and resources needed for reconciliation and auditing processes. Additionally  the automated smart contract functionality may increase operational efficiency by reducing manual interventions and the associated risk of errors. However  it is fundamental to em- phasise that these efficiency gains are theoretical at this stage and would require empirical validation in future research. The true efficiency of the BFS system across various metrics can only be determined through rigorous testing and comparison with existing systems once a full implementation has been developed.,,weak,0.0031,1.2,1.0,0,0.3422

BitFury [46] has revealed that Allied Control (AC)  a BitFury Family afﬁliate  has discovered an innovation in data center sustainability. AC takes pride in the installation of a cooling system in two phases. This tends to increase the energy density from 5 to 10 kW at the peak value of 250 kW. The cooling energy usage is also reduced by more than 96%  with a PUE of 1.02. This successfully achieves sustainability in cost and time. Researchers offered a number of contradictory comments in the form of reports addressing the use of electricity by speciﬁc Bitcoin facilities. Huang [47] stated that the facility was powered by Energies 2023  16  1510 14 of 24 40 megawatt. On the other hand  Tech in Asia [48] released a report with a power estimate of 33.33 MW  which corresponds to 800 MWh each day. At this point  it certainly cannot be precluded that hash rate is the only factor that reﬂects a signiﬁcant portion of the electricity required in Bitcoin mining at this moment. 4.4. A Novel Solution for Energy Preservation Bitcoin mining is supposed to use as much energy in 2025 as we use in the whole world for everything.

For that  we actually need something different  portable  and obviously new to help maintain and eventually reduce energy consumption. In the early stage (around 2012)  people used air conditioning as a solution  but later it was found out that these air conditions have their own enormous use of energy [ 35] as they remain on throughout the period. Therefore  instead of installing air conditioners  there is a need to adapt something from nature. The entire setup of miners is put inside the ﬂuids that ultimately absorb the heat and provide immersion cooling.

Low-code platforms allow organizations to develop  and deploy applications quickly  reducing the time and cost  associated with traditional software development. These  platforms also facilitate seamless integration with existing  systems  making them valuable tools for modernizing legacy  infrastructures without extensive redevelopment efforts.

The scalability of the Alphabill platform is founded on the scalability of its individual partitions. KSI Cash is part of this foundation  and a part of the Alphabill family of technologies. • Exhaustive KSI Cash Performance Evaluation. We present diverse performance tests of KSI Cash that we have conducted with the European Central Bank and the said group of eight central banks [19]. We show the system operating with 100 million wallets and 15 thousand transactions per second under simulation of realistic usage. Furthermore  we show the system operating with up to 2 million payment orders per second (an equivalent of more than 300 000 transactions per second in our technology) in a laboratory setting that runs with the central components of KSI Cash. These tests show that the technology scales linearly in terms of the number of deployed shards. Furthermore  we are able to estimate the carbon footprint of KSI Cash as 0.0001g CO2 per transaction  again under the realistic usage scenario (as compared to Bitcoin  which amounts to much more than 100 kg CO2 per payment transaction according to several existing studies). • Bill Scheme. We explain  in detail  the key concepts that unlock the performance of KSI Cash  i.e.  a new form of electronic money scheme  the bill scheme [21]  [22]  which achieves full decomposability by circumvention of monetary splits and joins. The analysis indicates that the performance of our technology is unlimited for prac- tical purposes  in both permissioned and permissionless scenarios. • Alphabill Platform Architecture. We provide the archi- tecture of the Alphabill platform  see Fig. 1. The Alphabill platform enables universal asset tokeniza- tion  transfer and exchange as a global medium of exchange. The platform allows users to launch an arbitrary number of new so-called partitions. Each partition implements an individual token and corre- sponding transaction system.

Availability,5,SUHXIEJV,Solutions to Scalability of Blockchain: A Survey,2020,Methodology,US Hybrid Consensus is a protocol that combines some classical consensus protocols. ByzCoin [25] proposes a two-phase protocol based on the idea of Bitcoin-NG [15]. However  it is able to ensure strong consistency by combining PoW and PBFT. In addition  ByzCoin uses a collective signing protocol called Cosi [71] to reduce the cost of the prepare and commit phases of PBFT and scale it to large consensus groups. Later works such as Hybrid consensus [72]  Solidus [73] also propose to combine different protocols with PoW aiming to improve on the throughput and security. Algorand [16] is a cryptocurrency based on a Byzantine Agreement (BA) protocol. By combining with V eriﬁable Random Functions [74]  users are chosen to become a com- mittee member to participate in the BA and reach consensus on the next set of transactions. To mitigate targeted attacks  the participant will be replaced after sending a message in BA. With all these approaches  Algorand scales to 500 000 users in experiments and achieves high throughput. f: OTHER CONSENSUS Some other new consensus algorithms have been proposed in recent years  including PoA (proof-of-authority) [75]  PoC (proof of capacity) [76] and PoP (proof-of-Participation) [77]  which make some modiﬁcations of the previous con- sensus to improve the scalability of blockchain. PoP (Proof of Participation) is a new protocol that imple- ments PoS through the mining mechanism of PoW. PoP selects a list of stakeholders to work out a computational task  which is simpler than that in PoW  to generate a new block. Other stakeholders who did not participate in the mining validate the block and propagate it. Unlike PoS  transaction fees in PoP are only distributed to stakeholders participat- ing in validation and propagation  which thus encourages stakeholders to maintain an online node and sustain the sys- tem. PoP includes two layers of security  proof-of-work  and proof-of-stake  that protect the system from security prob- lems (e.g. double-spending) and also consume less energy than the traditional PoW mechanism. PoC (Proof of Capacity) is a consensus algorithm that uti- lizes the storage resource (disk space) to mine.,throughput; scalability; security; consistency,medium,0.0025,1.3,1.0,0,0.3617

Geo-Inf. 2021  10  35 10 of 22 The process of conducting changes in LIS basically relies on a single database table. However  implementing the history of changes has been proved to be a complex and error-prone task  with the examples of deliberate changes in the database tables [58]. This creates the opportunity and gives the motivation to secure such records on a blockchain. Furthermore  the mentioned table is append-only which means that apart from inserting new rows no other operations  such as update or delete  should be allowed. This is in line with the blockchain transaction recording capabilities. The main privacy issue related to transactions in LIS that has been witnessed in previous years is that the database containing transactions data can be compromised. There have been reported cases of deliberate or non-deliberate errors in the table of changes that might cause problems. Therefore  a lot of paper documents are kept supporting the integrity of data saved in the database. Blockchain may increase overall conﬁdence in the system. LIS data is public for reading except for personally sensitive information or details about restrictions (such as the value of a mortgage or creditor)  but only selected users can modify data in it according to the assigned roles and privileges.

Tx format includes three new fields: ID  DependsOn  Blockref  and Expiration ;  2. Each Tx has its own ID; thereby  the application deals with a single Tx instead of a Tx bundle of Txs ;  3. Blockref delivers additional information about the previous  current  and next block. Also  it gives info about Tx  creation time. It will be helpful for financial purposes in case of acceptance delay  for example ;  4. Expiration is added to the Tx to avoid stacking for a long time. In addition  a Tx can do additional POW to speed  up the validation time (it can consume more to track miners' attention  but the extra pow will compensate its  loss);  5. Multi-task transaction: a Tx is composed of many small Txs to address the complex business payments. Vechain  uses Proof of Authority ""POA"" as a consensus algorithm that considers both stake and reputation. The maximum Tx speed announced is 10k Tx per second. As future work  they are looking for involving side chains  to enhance the scalability of  the vechain system. Vechainthor introduces the new multilayer payment model to ensure  the token stability price. Two tokens are utili zed to fulfill the Tx process: VET and VTHO.

E. DECENTRALIZED FINANCE DEFI AND SMART CONTRACTS Decentralized ﬁnance (DeFi) is a Blockchain-based ﬁnancial infrastructure that has recently grown in popularity. The term refers to a set of protocols established on open  unlicensed  and highly interoperable public smart contract systems  such as the Ethereum blockchain [6]  [18]. Traditional ﬁnancial services have been updated to be more open and transparent. The problem  in particular  does not rely on centralized orga- nizations or intermediaries. Instead  decentralized applica- tions and open protocols are used (DApps). The code ensures that agreements are followed  that transactions are safe and secure  and that allowed status changes are recorded on a public blockchain. As a result  this architecture can create an irreversible and highly interoperable ﬁnancial system with unparalleled transparency  equal access rights  and little need for custodians  central clearinghouses  or escrow services because ‘‘smart contracts’’ can handle the majority of these functions. DeFi uses a multi-layered architecture. Every layer has a distinct role. The layers are built on top of each other  resulting in an open and highly composable infrastructure that anyone can build on  rehash  or use. Here are the different layers of the DeFi stack [21]  [6]  for example: - The settlement layer allows the network to securely store ownership data and guarantees that any state changes adhere to its set of rules. - The asset layer: This category includes all assets issued on top of the settlement layer. This includes the native protocol asset as well as any other assets that have been issued on this Blockchain (usually referred to as tokens). - The protocol layer: The standards cover speciﬁc use cases such as decentralized exchanges  debt markets  derivatives  and on-chain asset management. These standards are commonly implemented as a set of open-access smart contracts (or DeFi applications).,security,weak,0.0028,1.2,1.0,0,0.3419

Unveiling the Concept of Decentralized Finance (DeFi).  Decentralized Finance (DeFi) represents a paradigm shift in the financial sector  moving away from traditional   centralized systems towards a more open  transparent  and accessible framework. This innovative concept  primarily  built on the Ethereum platform  offers an alternative to conventional financial infrastructure  leveraging blockchain  technology to democratize financial services (Umarov  Umarov  & Umarov  2022). World Journal of Advanced Research and Reviews  2024  21(01)  2313–2328  2314  At its core  DeFi is a system where financial products become available on a public decentralized blockchain network   making them open to anyone to use  rather than going through intermediaries like banks or brokerages (dos Santos et  al.  2022). Unlike traditional finance  DeFi is characterized by its open -source nature  immutable transactions  and lack  of centralized control. This means that DeFi platforms operate without a central authority  using smart contracts - self- executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code. The emergence of DeFi can be traced back to the development of blockchain technology and the introduction of Bitcoin  in 2008  which laid the foundation for decentralized financial systems. However  it was the launch of Ethereum in 2015   a Turing -complete blockchain that significantl y expanded the scope of blockchain -based financial systems beyond  simple cryptocurrency transactions (dos Santos et al.  2022). Ethereum's introduction of smart contracts enabled the  creation of more complex financial services  such as lending  borrowing  and yield farming  all operating in a trustless  environment. DeFi's growth has been meteoric  with the total value locked (TVL) in DeFi protocols surging from a mere $4 billion to  over $100 billion in just a few years  reflecting its increasing popularity and the growing trust in its underlying  technology (Jensen  von Wachter  & Ross  2021). This explosive growth can be attributed to several factors  including  the transparency of blockchain technology  the potential for higher returns compared to traditiona l banking  and the  inclusivity and accessibility of DeFi platforms. One of the most significant advantages of DeFi is its potential to offer financial services to the unbanked and  underbanked populations.,,weak,0.0024,1.2,1.0,0,0.3417
Availability,14,95TMJST6,Blockchain as IoT Economy Enabler: A Review of Architectural Aspects,2022,Introduction,The Internet of Things (IoT) is a network of tiny devices connected over the Internet to observe the physical world  gather data  and consciously act on it in a useful way. Billions of connected IoT devices are expected to bring a substantial added value for communities and for individuals  also in view of the fact that IoT is tightly connected with several well-known trends  such as Big Data  smart cities  and Industry 4.0  which promise to deeply change many aspects of our lives in the future. As an example  the unprecedented amount of data gathered by billions of IoT sensors will bring us the ability to get new insights and actionable intelligence regarding our world [1 2]. The pervasive presence of smart connected devices will enable the development of innovative services to improve our lives [3] and to face new and unexpected challenges  such as the COVID-19 outbreak [4]  and private and public objects (i.e.  things) will be available to anyone for renting  even for a short time  to support a new form of shared economy [5]. The general problem of giving a reward to subjects that contribute to this novel added value ecosystem is not only an economic or business-related question. Many IoT applications are peculiar regarding the amount of involved users  the volume and diversity of generated data  the frequency of economic transactions and their latency constraints  J. Sens. Actuator Netw. 2022  11  20. https://doi.org/10.3390/jsan11020020 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/jsan J. Sens. Actuator Netw. 2022  11  20 2 of 36 as well as security requirements. Hence  related technical and architectural aspects are by themselves an interesting cross-cutting dimension for many IoT applications. This is even more compelling if we observe that decentralization is going to be a fundamental aspect of evolved IoT ecosystems. In fact  a single organization handling a vast amount of heterogeneous and pervasive IoT devices is not simply unrealistic  but also unfeasible. We expect that in the more complex scenarios  many organizations will contribute to a single IoT ecosystem. Furthermore  the pervasive nature of IoT deployments usually requires the involvement of end-users that buy  deploy  and contribute their devices to an ecosystem on the basis of some kind of future advantage. Ecosystems of this kind grow as more people are willing to contribute  and not (only) under the pressure of centralized investments.,latency; tps; security,weak,0.0024,1.2,1.0,0,0.3417

It acknowledges the interoperabil- ity of parallel chains  which may engage in cross-chain interactions to reinforce the performance of one another. A standard created by Polkadot 2.0 called XCM [17] enables protocol design- ers to specify the types of data and sources from which their chains can send and receive data. It comes with one virtual machine that enables flexible execution and one virtual machine al- lows for adaptable execution. Another pioneer in the BoBs ecosystem is Cosmos. According to the IBC [67]  Cosmos is an end-to-end  connection-oriented  stateful protocol used to provide authenticated  reliable communication across diverse blockchains arranged in a dynamic topol- ogy. These advancements in the Polkadot ecosystem enhance the versatility and e fficiency of cross-chain communication and execution  ultimately contributing to the broader development of blockchain technology. Chainlink created CCIP [32]  focusing on end-to-end security  futur- istic interoperability  and an easy development process. The CCIP infrastructure consists of three layers: a message layer (programmable pass bridge)  a transport layer (CCIP core)  and a decen- tralized prophet network (DON) based on the OCR2.0 protocol. External developers only need to develop sender and receiver contracts  all other components are included in the CCIP service  and the developers can easily interact across chains through a unified interface. LayerZero [153] is a trustless interoperability protocol  which provides a powerful  low-level communication prim- itive upon which a diverse set of cross-chain applications can be built.

Milestones in DeFi Development in the U.S. The evolution of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) in the United States is a testament to the dynamic interplay between  technological innovation and financial services. The journey of DeFi  from its nascent stages to becoming a significant  part of the financial landscape  is marked by several key milestones that reflect its growing impact and integration into  the broader economy. The early stages of DeFi's development coincided with the advent of blockchain technology and the introduction of  Bitcoin in 2008. However  it was the launch of Ethereum in 2015  with its groundbreaking smart contract capabilities   that truly set the stage for the DeFi revolution. The United States  known for its innovative spirit and technological  prowess  quickly emerged as a fertile  ground for the growth and development of DeFi applications. Protocols such as  MakerDAO  Compound  and Uniswap gained prominence  offering decentralized services like lending  borrowing  and  trading  which challenged traditional financial models by elimina ting intermediaries (Umarov  Umarov  & Umarov   2022). A pivotal moment in DeFi's journey was its increasing integration with traditional financial systems. Major financial  institutions in the U.S. began to recognize the potential of blockchain technology i n transforming finance. This  integration marked a shift in perception  positioning DeFi not just as an alternative but as a complementary component  of the broader financial ecosystem. This period saw significant investments from traditional financial entit ies into DeFi  projects  signaling a blending of the old with the new (Ozili  2022). Technological advancements and innovations have been at the heart of DeFi's growth in the U.S. Innovations such as  yield farming  liquidity mining  and the introduction of governance tokens have not only attracted a broader user base  but have also enhanced the functionality and efficiency of DeFi services. These innovations reflect the sector's  commitment to evolving and adapting to user needs and market dynamics (Umarov  Um arov  & Umarov  2022). The Ethereum Merge  which marked the transition of the Ethereum blockchain from proof -of-work (PoW) to proof-of- stake (PoS)  was another significant milestone for DeFi.,,weak,0.0026,1.0,1.0,0,0.3018

Originally built for internal agents   it was later enhanced to support external users  offering a seamless experience on d esktop  mobile  and tablet (iPad)  platforms. The redesign focused on creating a more intuitive and interactive interface while ensuring consistent  functionality across all devices. The system was built using Java  Spring MVC  Gradle  AngularJS  jQuery  and  FTL  with Oracle databases and both  REST and SOAP web services to connect smoothly with external systems. A modular design  clean coding standards   and automated testing with JUnit  HP ALM  and SonarQube helped ensure reliability and maintainability. Depl oyments  on Tomcat and WebLogic servers were carefully validated  keeping post-production issues to a minimum. Users benefited from faster  more responsive interfaces  and the system consistently handled transactions securely and  efficiently. The project‟s success was supported by strong collaboration across teams  structured delivery cycles  and  thoughtful attention to both technical and user experience considerations. Overall  the C2C Transfer System demonstrates how thoughtful design and careful engineeri ng can deliver a reliable   user-friendly  and scalable financial application ready for future growth.

Scalability,5,SUHXIEJV,Solutions to Scalability of Blockchain: A Survey,2020,Methodology,US Hybrid Consensus is a protocol that combines some classical consensus protocols. ByzCoin [25] proposes a two-phase protocol based on the idea of Bitcoin-NG [15]. However  it is able to ensure strong consistency by combining PoW and PBFT. In addition  ByzCoin uses a collective signing protocol called Cosi [71] to reduce the cost of the prepare and commit phases of PBFT and scale it to large consensus groups. Later works such as Hybrid consensus [72]  Solidus [73] also propose to combine different protocols with PoW aiming to improve on the throughput and security. Algorand [16] is a cryptocurrency based on a Byzantine Agreement (BA) protocol. By combining with V eriﬁable Random Functions [74]  users are chosen to become a com- mittee member to participate in the BA and reach consensus on the next set of transactions. To mitigate targeted attacks  the participant will be replaced after sending a message in BA. With all these approaches  Algorand scales to 500 000 users in experiments and achieves high throughput. f: OTHER CONSENSUS Some other new consensus algorithms have been proposed in recent years  including PoA (proof-of-authority) [75]  PoC (proof of capacity) [76] and PoP (proof-of-Participation) [77]  which make some modiﬁcations of the previous con- sensus to improve the scalability of blockchain. PoP (Proof of Participation) is a new protocol that imple- ments PoS through the mining mechanism of PoW. PoP selects a list of stakeholders to work out a computational task  which is simpler than that in PoW  to generate a new block. Other stakeholders who did not participate in the mining validate the block and propagate it. Unlike PoS  transaction fees in PoP are only distributed to stakeholders participat- ing in validation and propagation  which thus encourages stakeholders to maintain an online node and sustain the sys- tem. PoP includes two layers of security  proof-of-work  and proof-of-stake  that protect the system from security prob- lems (e.g. double-spending) and also consume less energy than the traditional PoW mechanism.

Geo-Inf. 2021  10  35 10 of 22 The process of conducting changes in LIS basically relies on a single database table. However  implementing the history of changes has been proved to be a complex and error-prone task  with the examples of deliberate changes in the database tables [58]. This creates the opportunity and gives the motivation to secure such records on a blockchain. Furthermore  the mentioned table is append-only which means that apart from inserting new rows no other operations  such as update or delete  should be allowed. This is in line with the blockchain transaction recording capabilities. The main privacy issue related to transactions in LIS that has been witnessed in previous years is that the database containing transactions data can be compromised. There have been reported cases of deliberate or non-deliberate errors in the table of changes that might cause problems. Therefore  a lot of paper documents are kept supporting the integrity of data saved in the database. Blockchain may increase overall conﬁdence in the system. LIS data is public for reading except for personally sensitive information or details about restrictions (such as the value of a mortgage or creditor)  but only selected users can modify data in it according to the assigned roles and privileges.

Vechainthor is an enhanced version of Blockchain. It is forked and improved based on  the Ethereum codebase. The following are the enhancements:  1. Tx format includes three new fields: ID  DependsOn  Blockref  and Expiration ;  2. Each Tx has its own ID; thereby  the application deals with a single Tx instead of a Tx bundle of Txs ;  3. Blockref delivers additional information about the previous  current  and next block. Also  it gives info about Tx  creation time. It will be helpful for financial purposes in case of acceptance delay  for example ;  4. Expiration is added to the Tx to avoid stacking for a long time. In addition  a Tx can do additional POW to speed  up the validation time (it can consume more to track miners' attention  but the extra pow will compensate its  loss);  5. Multi-task transaction: a Tx is composed of many small Txs to address the complex business payments. Vechain  uses Proof of Authority ""POA"" as a consensus algorithm that considers both stake and reputation. The maximum Tx speed announced is 10k Tx per second. As future work  they are looking for involving side chains  to enhance the scalability of  the vechain system. Vechainthor introduces the new multilayer payment model to ensure  the token stability price. Two tokens are utili zed to fulfill the Tx process: VET and VTHO.

As illustrated in Figure 2  it  is composed of parent chain and sub -chains with cryptocurrency named WTC  running and mined on the parent chain. A sub -chain is working separately after being created and registered inside the  parent chain. The parent ledger contains only detailed informat ion related to the sub -chains. Each sub -chain has its  ledger and can be created and registered any time under the parent chain network. Parent chain consensus is a  combination of POW  POS  and POL. Besides  its block creation time is 60 seconds. Its ledger  size is not affected by  the number of sub-chains since the parent chain runs independently of sub -chains. Thus  the parent chain is considered  scalable and secure. In addition  the smart contract is the foundation of waltonchain that builds and maintains the  underlying logic platform.

Trading platforms Gochain and Menlo one are now using PoR. Because a ﬁxed group of validators mining  the PoAuthority  and PoR algorithms make the blockchain network less decentralized  furthermore  they have not been thoroughly tested for performance and security issues [12]  [27]  [28]. E. DECENTRALIZED FINANCE DEFI AND SMART CONTRACTS Decentralized ﬁnance (DeFi) is a Blockchain-based ﬁnancial infrastructure that has recently grown in popularity. The term refers to a set of protocols established on open  unlicensed  and highly interoperable public smart contract systems  such as the Ethereum blockchain [6]  [18]. Traditional ﬁnancial services have been updated to be more open and transparent. The problem  in particular  does not rely on centralized orga- nizations or intermediaries. Instead  decentralized applica- tions and open protocols are used (DApps). The code ensures that agreements are followed  that transactions are safe and secure  and that allowed status changes are recorded on a public blockchain. As a result  this architecture can create an irreversible and highly interoperable ﬁnancial system with unparalleled transparency  equal access rights  and little need for custodians  central clearinghouses  or escrow services because ‘‘smart contracts’’ can handle the majority of these functions. DeFi uses a multi-layered architecture. Every layer has a distinct role. The layers are built on top of each other  resulting in an open and highly composable infrastructure that anyone can build on  rehash  or use. Here are the different layers of the DeFi stack [21]  [6]  for example: - The settlement layer allows the network to securely store ownership data and guarantees that any state changes adhere to its set of rules. - The asset layer: This category includes all assets issued on top of the settlement layer. This includes the native protocol asset as well as any other assets that have been issued on this Blockchain (usually referred to as tokens). - The protocol layer: The standards cover speciﬁc use cases such as decentralized exchanges  debt markets  derivatives  and on-chain asset management. These standards are commonly implemented as a set of open-access smart contracts (or DeFi applications).,security,weak,0.0028,1.2,1.0,0,0.3419

FinTech  the combination of  technology and financial services [13  p.3; 14]  has become  a well-discussed area of study in the new era of the busi- ness industry. FinTech companies offer many services  such  as digital cash  cognitive systems  and distributed ledger  technology. Traditional financial organizations and start-up  companies are increasingly partnering with FinTech [15] to  provide user-friendly and cost-effective financial electronic  services. Blockchain is a common FinTech that transforms  how financial businesses operate  collaborate  and transact  with their stakeholders [16]. This suggests that the decentral- ized financial network is bringing about a major financial  sector revolution with the enhancement of digital wallets as a  crucial component of financial inclusion. The decentralized  electronic ledger system will transform the way transactions  are carried out  changing the shape and size of the financial  sector. Studies [1   17] have demonstrated that research on  blockchain applications can save business money and open  up new commercial and export opportunities  both of which  will expand in the near future.,,medium,0.0026,1.2,1.0,0,0.3418

Unveiling the Concept of Decentralized Finance (DeFi).  Decentralized Finance (DeFi) represents a paradigm shift in the financial sector  moving away from traditional   centralized systems towards a more open  transparent  and accessible framework. This innovative concept  primarily  built on the Ethereum platform  offers an alternative to conventional financial infrastructure  leveraging blockchain  technology to democratize financial services (Umarov  Umarov  & Umarov  2022). World Journal of Advanced Research and Reviews  2024  21(01)  2313–2328  2314  At its core  DeFi is a system where financial products become available on a public decentralized blockchain network   making them open to anyone to use  rather than going through intermediaries like banks or brokerages (dos Santos et  al.  2022). Unlike traditional finance  DeFi is characterized by its open -source nature  immutable transactions  and lack  of centralized control. This means that DeFi platforms operate without a central authority  using smart contracts - self- executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code. The emergence of DeFi can be traced back to the development of blockchain technology and the introduction of Bitcoin  in 2008  which laid the foundation for decentralized financial systems. However  it was the launch of Ethereum in 2015   a Turing -complete blockchain that significantl y expanded the scope of blockchain -based financial systems beyond  simple cryptocurrency transactions (dos Santos et al.  2022). Ethereum's introduction of smart contracts enabled the  creation of more complex financial services  such as lending  borrowing  and yield farming  all operating in a trustless  environment. DeFi's growth has been meteoric  with the total value locked (TVL) in DeFi protocols surging from a mere $4 billion to  over $100 billion in just a few years  reflecting its increasing popularity and the growing trust in its underlying  technology (Jensen  von Wachter  & Ross  2021). This explosive growth can be attributed to several factors  including  the transparency of blockchain technology  the potential for higher returns compared to traditiona l banking  and the  inclusivity and accessibility of DeFi platforms. One of the most significant advantages of DeFi is its potential to offer financial services to the unbanked and  underbanked populations.,,weak,0.0024,1.2,1.0,0,0.3417
Scalability,14,95TMJST6,Blockchain as IoT Economy Enabler: A Review of Architectural Aspects,2022,Introduction,The Internet of Things (IoT) is a network of tiny devices connected over the Internet to observe the physical world  gather data  and consciously act on it in a useful way. Billions of connected IoT devices are expected to bring a substantial added value for communities and for individuals  also in view of the fact that IoT is tightly connected with several well-known trends  such as Big Data  smart cities  and Industry 4.0  which promise to deeply change many aspects of our lives in the future. As an example  the unprecedented amount of data gathered by billions of IoT sensors will bring us the ability to get new insights and actionable intelligence regarding our world [1 2]. The pervasive presence of smart connected devices will enable the development of innovative services to improve our lives [3] and to face new and unexpected challenges  such as the COVID-19 outbreak [4]  and private and public objects (i.e.  things) will be available to anyone for renting  even for a short time  to support a new form of shared economy [5]. The general problem of giving a reward to subjects that contribute to this novel added value ecosystem is not only an economic or business-related question. Many IoT applications are peculiar regarding the amount of involved users  the volume and diversity of generated data  the frequency of economic transactions and their latency constraints  J. Sens.

Hence  related technical and architectural aspects are by themselves an interesting cross-cutting dimension for many IoT applications. This is even more compelling if we observe that decentralization is going to be a fundamental aspect of evolved IoT ecosystems. In fact  a single organization handling a vast amount of heterogeneous and pervasive IoT devices is not simply unrealistic  but also unfeasible. We expect that in the more complex scenarios  many organizations will contribute to a single IoT ecosystem. Furthermore  the pervasive nature of IoT deployments usually requires the involvement of end-users that buy  deploy  and contribute their devices to an ecosystem on the basis of some kind of future advantage. Ecosystems of this kind grow as more people are willing to contribute  and not (only) under the pressure of centralized investments.,latency; tps; security,weak,0.0024,1.2,1.0,0,0.3417

As a forerunner of public BoBs  Polkadot [130] standardizes the method for passing mes- sages between parallel chains of homogenous relay networks. It acknowledges the interoperabil- ity of parallel chains  which may engage in cross-chain interactions to reinforce the performance of one another. A standard created by Polkadot 2.0 called XCM [17] enables protocol design- ers to specify the types of data and sources from which their chains can send and receive data. It comes with one virtual machine that enables flexible execution and one virtual machine al- lows for adaptable execution. Another pioneer in the BoBs ecosystem is Cosmos. According to the IBC [67]  Cosmos is an end-to-end  connection-oriented  stateful protocol used to provide authenticated  reliable communication across diverse blockchains arranged in a dynamic topol- ogy. These advancements in the Polkadot ecosystem enhance the versatility and e fficiency of cross-chain communication and execution  ultimately contributing to the broader development of blockchain technology. Chainlink created CCIP [32]  focusing on end-to-end security  futur- istic interoperability  and an easy development process.

External developers only need to develop sender and receiver contracts  all other components are included in the CCIP service  and the developers can easily interact across chains through a unified interface. LayerZero [153] is a trustless interoperability protocol  which provides a powerful  low-level communication prim- itive upon which a diverse set of cross-chain applications can be built.

Milestones in DeFi Development in the U.S. The evolution of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) in the United States is a testament to the dynamic interplay between  technological innovation and financial services. The journey of DeFi  from its nascent stages to becoming a significant  part of the financial landscape  is marked by several key milestones that reflect its growing impact and integration into  the broader economy. The early stages of DeFi's development coincided with the advent of blockchain technology and the introduction of  Bitcoin in 2008. However  it was the launch of Ethereum in 2015  with its groundbreaking smart contract capabilities   that truly set the stage for the DeFi revolution. The United States  known for its innovative spirit and technological  prowess  quickly emerged as a fertile  ground for the growth and development of DeFi applications. Protocols such as  MakerDAO  Compound  and Uniswap gained prominence  offering decentralized services like lending  borrowing  and  trading  which challenged traditional financial models by elimina ting intermediaries (Umarov  Umarov  & Umarov   2022). A pivotal moment in DeFi's journey was its increasing integration with traditional financial systems. Major financial  institutions in the U.S. began to recognize the potential of blockchain technology i n transforming finance. This  integration marked a shift in perception  positioning DeFi not just as an alternative but as a complementary component  of the broader financial ecosystem. This period saw significant investments from traditional financial entit ies into DeFi  projects  signaling a blending of the old with the new (Ozili  2022). Technological advancements and innovations have been at the heart of DeFi's growth in the U.S. Innovations such as  yield farming  liquidity mining  and the introduction of governance tokens have not only attracted a broader user base  but have also enhanced the functionality and efficiency of DeFi services. These innovations reflect the sector's  commitment to evolving and adapting to user needs and market dynamics (Umarov  Um arov  & Umarov  2022). The Ethereum Merge  which marked the transition of the Ethereum blockchain from proof -of-work (PoW) to proof-of- stake (PoS)  was another significant milestone for DeFi.,,weak,0.0026,1.0,1.0,0,0.3018

Originally built for internal agents   it was later enhanced to support external users  offering a seamless experience on d esktop  mobile  and tablet (iPad)  platforms. The redesign focused on creating a more intuitive and interactive interface while ensuring consistent  functionality across all devices. The system was built using Java  Spring MVC  Gradle  AngularJS  jQuery  and  FTL  with Oracle databases and both  REST and SOAP web services to connect smoothly with external systems. A modular design  clean coding standards   and automated testing with JUnit  HP ALM  and SonarQube helped ensure reliability and maintainability. Depl oyments  on Tomcat and WebLogic servers were carefully validated  keeping post-production issues to a minimum. Users benefited from faster  more responsive interfaces  and the system consistently handled transactions securely and  efficiently. The project‟s success was supported by strong collaboration across teams  structured delivery cycles  and  thoughtful attention to both technical and user experience considerations. Overall  the C2C Transfer System demonstrates how thoughtful design and careful engineeri ng can deliver a reliable   user-friendly  and scalable financial application ready for future growth.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) for Blockchain Scalability  AI can play a crucial role in enhancing blockchain scalability by optimizing network  performance  enabling predictive sc aling  and improving consensus algorithms. Some  specific applications of AI include:  ● Predictive Load Balancing:  AI algorithms can predict transaction traffic  patterns and optimize the allocation of resources across the blockchain network. By anticipating p eriods of high demand  AI can dynamically adjust resource  allocation  ensuring the network can scale effectively without overloading nodes. ● Intelligent Consensus Mechanisms:  AI could be employed to improve  consensus algorithms  making them more efficient a nd adaptable to changing  network conditions. For example  machine learning techniques could be used to  analyze network performance and adjust parameters of consensus protocols like  Proof-of-Work or Proof-of-Stake to improve throughput and minimize latency. ● Automated Fraud Detection: AI can help detect and prevent malicious activity  by analyzing transaction patterns and identifying anomalies that could indicate  fraud. This contributes to enhancing the security and reliability of blockchain  systems as they scale.,throughput; latency; scalability; security,weak,0.0024,1.4,1.0,0,0.3817

Everex partners with banks targeting underbanked populations and allows workers to send money home without paying high remittance fees. Merchants must be partnered with SureRemit and accept tokens. Everex needs to have licensed exchange partners in the country of receipt to exchange tokens into local currency. Cost of Compliance Among Different Regulatory Environments SureRemit leverages the Stellar platform and also acquires partner merchants to bypass different regulatory environments altogether by settling Remit tokens with ﬁat currency via Stellar. - The Token can only be used to make purchases with partner merchants. Therefore  the money cannot be used if a partner merchant does not accept the Remit token. - Interoperability SureRemit has standardized the process regardless of country. The same information is required no matter where or with whom the transaction is placed. Everex has trusted banking partners in the countries they interact with  thus promising a 1:1 conversion rate of their eFiat stablecoins. - For the stable coins to be redeemed in Fiat currency  Everex must have local banking partners that operate within that currency. Otherwise  the eFiat cannot be sent/redeemed. Risk RemitToken is not subject to the volatility of currency exchange rates. Immediate and continuous liquidity provided by Stellar allows for the issuance and trading of tokens immediately. Therefore  they are not subject to the risk of exchange rates. The Everex Token is a dollar-pegged stablecoin  ensuring that the money being transferred is equivalent to the same ﬁat currency that is being transferred.

Maintainability,5,SUHXIEJV,Solutions to Scalability of Blockchain: A Survey,2020,Methodology,US Hybrid Consensus is a protocol that combines some classical consensus protocols. ByzCoin [25] proposes a two-phase protocol based on the idea of Bitcoin-NG [15]. However  it is able to ensure strong consistency by combining PoW and PBFT. In addition  ByzCoin uses a collective signing protocol called Cosi [71] to reduce the cost of the prepare and commit phases of PBFT and scale it to large consensus groups. Later works such as Hybrid consensus [72]  Solidus [73] also propose to combine different protocols with PoW aiming to improve on the throughput and security. Algorand [16] is a cryptocurrency based on a Byzantine Agreement (BA) protocol. By combining with V eriﬁable Random Functions [74]  users are chosen to become a com- mittee member to participate in the BA and reach consensus on the next set of transactions. To mitigate targeted attacks  the participant will be replaced after sending a message in BA. With all these approaches  Algorand scales to 500 000 users in experiments and achieves high throughput. f: OTHER CONSENSUS Some other new consensus algorithms have been proposed in recent years  including PoA (proof-of-authority) [75]  PoC (proof of capacity) [76] and PoP (proof-of-Participation) [77]  which make some modiﬁcations of the previous con- sensus to improve the scalability of blockchain. PoP (Proof of Participation) is a new protocol that imple- ments PoS through the mining mechanism of PoW. PoP selects a list of stakeholders to work out a computational task  which is simpler than that in PoW  to generate a new block. Other stakeholders who did not participate in the mining validate the block and propagate it. Unlike PoS  transaction fees in PoP are only distributed to stakeholders participat- ing in validation and propagation  which thus encourages stakeholders to maintain an online node and sustain the sys- tem. PoP includes two layers of security  proof-of-work  and proof-of-stake  that protect the system from security prob- lems (e.g. double-spending) and also consume less energy than the traditional PoW mechanism. PoC (Proof of Capacity) is a consensus algorithm that uti- lizes the storage resource (disk space) to mine.,throughput; scalability; security; consistency,medium,0.0025,1.3,1.0,0,0.3617

Geo-Inf. 2021  10  35 10 of 22 The process of conducting changes in LIS basically relies on a single database table. However  implementing the history of changes has been proved to be a complex and error-prone task  with the examples of deliberate changes in the database tables [58]. This creates the opportunity and gives the motivation to secure such records on a blockchain. Furthermore  the mentioned table is append-only which means that apart from inserting new rows no other operations  such as update or delete  should be allowed. This is in line with the blockchain transaction recording capabilities. The main privacy issue related to transactions in LIS that has been witnessed in previous years is that the database containing transactions data can be compromised. There have been reported cases of deliberate or non-deliberate errors in the table of changes that might cause problems. Therefore  a lot of paper documents are kept supporting the integrity of data saved in the database. Blockchain may increase overall conﬁdence in the system. LIS data is public for reading except for personally sensitive information or details about restrictions (such as the value of a mortgage or creditor)  but only selected users can modify data in it according to the assigned roles and privileges.

Requirements for Blockchain-Based LIS In order to establish blockchain-based LIS  key requirements should be addressed to launch a blockchain-based cadastral system. This includes: • Analysis whether blockchain network should be public or private and authorised and how identity management will be handled. • What data will comprise one transaction in a blockchain. • How smart contracts will be used and what business logic should be implemented and executed on a blockchain. 4.1.

E. DECENTRALIZED FINANCE DEFI AND SMART CONTRACTS Decentralized ﬁnance (DeFi) is a Blockchain-based ﬁnancial infrastructure that has recently grown in popularity. The term refers to a set of protocols established on open  unlicensed  and highly interoperable public smart contract systems  such as the Ethereum blockchain [6]  [18]. Traditional ﬁnancial services have been updated to be more open and transparent. The problem  in particular  does not rely on centralized orga- nizations or intermediaries. Instead  decentralized applica- tions and open protocols are used (DApps). The code ensures that agreements are followed  that transactions are safe and secure  and that allowed status changes are recorded on a public blockchain. As a result  this architecture can create an irreversible and highly interoperable ﬁnancial system with unparalleled transparency  equal access rights  and little need for custodians  central clearinghouses  or escrow services because ‘‘smart contracts’’ can handle the majority of these functions. DeFi uses a multi-layered architecture. Every layer has a distinct role. The layers are built on top of each other  resulting in an open and highly composable infrastructure that anyone can build on  rehash  or use. Here are the different layers of the DeFi stack [21]  [6]  for example: - The settlement layer allows the network to securely store ownership data and guarantees that any state changes adhere to its set of rules. - The asset layer: This category includes all assets issued on top of the settlement layer. This includes the native protocol asset as well as any other assets that have been issued on this Blockchain (usually referred to as tokens). - The protocol layer: The standards cover speciﬁc use cases such as decentralized exchanges  debt markets  derivatives  and on-chain asset management. These standards are commonly implemented as a set of open-access smart contracts (or DeFi applications).,security,weak,0.0028,1.2,1.0,0,0.3419

S. economy: A review: Assessing the rise, challenges, and implications of blockchain-driven financial systems.",2024,Introduction,1.1. Unveiling the Concept of Decentralized Finance (DeFi).  Decentralized Finance (DeFi) represents a paradigm shift in the financial sector  moving away from traditional   centralized systems towards a more open  transparent  and accessible framework. This innovative concept  primarily  built on the Ethereum platform  offers an alternative to conventional financial infrastructure  leveraging blockchain  technology to democratize financial services (Umarov  Umarov  & Umarov  2022). World Journal of Advanced Research and Reviews  2024  21(01)  2313–2328  2314  At its core  DeFi is a system where financial products become available on a public decentralized blockchain network   making them open to anyone to use  rather than going through intermediaries like banks or brokerages (dos Santos et  al.  2022). Unlike traditional finance  DeFi is characterized by its open -source nature  immutable transactions  and lack  of centralized control. This means that DeFi platforms operate without a central authority  using smart contracts - self- executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code. The emergence of DeFi can be traced back to the development of blockchain technology and the introduction of Bitcoin  in 2008  which laid the foundation for decentralized financial systems. However  it was the launch of Ethereum in 2015   a Turing -complete blockchain that significantl y expanded the scope of blockchain -based financial systems beyond  simple cryptocurrency transactions (dos Santos et al.  2022). Ethereum's introduction of smart contracts enabled the  creation of more complex financial services  such as lending  borrowing  and yield farming  all operating in a trustless  environment. DeFi's growth has been meteoric  with the total value locked (TVL) in DeFi protocols surging from a mere $4 billion to  over $100 billion in just a few years  reflecting its increasing popularity and the growing trust in its underlying  technology (Jensen  von Wachter  & Ross  2021). This explosive growth can be attributed to several factors  including  the transparency of blockchain technology  the potential for higher returns compared to traditiona l banking  and the  inclusivity and accessibility of DeFi platforms. One of the most significant advantages of DeFi is its potential to offer financial services to the unbanked and  underbanked populations.,,weak,0.0024,1.2,1.0,0,0.3417
Maintainability,14,95TMJST6,Blockchain as IoT Economy Enabler: A Review of Architectural Aspects,2022,Introduction,The Internet of Things (IoT) is a network of tiny devices connected over the Internet to observe the physical world  gather data  and consciously act on it in a useful way. Billions of connected IoT devices are expected to bring a substantial added value for communities and for individuals  also in view of the fact that IoT is tightly connected with several well-known trends  such as Big Data  smart cities  and Industry 4.0  which promise to deeply change many aspects of our lives in the future. As an example  the unprecedented amount of data gathered by billions of IoT sensors will bring us the ability to get new insights and actionable intelligence regarding our world [1 2]. The pervasive presence of smart connected devices will enable the development of innovative services to improve our lives [3] and to face new and unexpected challenges  such as the COVID-19 outbreak [4]  and private and public objects (i.e.  things) will be available to anyone for renting  even for a short time  to support a new form of shared economy [5]. The general problem of giving a reward to subjects that contribute to this novel added value ecosystem is not only an economic or business-related question. Many IoT applications are peculiar regarding the amount of involved users  the volume and diversity of generated data  the frequency of economic transactions and their latency constraints  J. Sens.

Hence  related technical and architectural aspects are by themselves an interesting cross-cutting dimension for many IoT applications. This is even more compelling if we observe that decentralization is going to be a fundamental aspect of evolved IoT ecosystems. In fact  a single organization handling a vast amount of heterogeneous and pervasive IoT devices is not simply unrealistic  but also unfeasible. We expect that in the more complex scenarios  many organizations will contribute to a single IoT ecosystem. Furthermore  the pervasive nature of IoT deployments usually requires the involvement of end-users that buy  deploy  and contribute their devices to an ecosystem on the basis of some kind of future advantage. Ecosystems of this kind grow as more people are willing to contribute  and not (only) under the pressure of centralized investments.,latency; tps; security,weak,0.0024,1.2,1.0,0,0.3417

It acknowledges the interoperabil- ity of parallel chains  which may engage in cross-chain interactions to reinforce the performance of one another. A standard created by Polkadot 2.0 called XCM [17] enables protocol design- ers to specify the types of data and sources from which their chains can send and receive data. It comes with one virtual machine that enables flexible execution and one virtual machine al- lows for adaptable execution. Another pioneer in the BoBs ecosystem is Cosmos.

Milestones in DeFi Development in the U.S. The evolution of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) in the United States is a testament to the dynamic interplay between  technological innovation and financial services. The journey of DeFi  from its nascent stages to becoming a significant  part of the financial landscape  is marked by several key milestones that reflect its growing impact and integration into  the broader economy. The early stages of DeFi's development coincided with the advent of blockchain technology and the introduction of  Bitcoin in 2008. However  it was the launch of Ethereum in 2015  with its groundbreaking smart contract capabilities   that truly set the stage for the DeFi revolution. The United States  known for its innovative spirit and technological  prowess  quickly emerged as a fertile  ground for the growth and development of DeFi applications. Protocols such as  MakerDAO  Compound  and Uniswap gained prominence  offering decentralized services like lending  borrowing  and  trading  which challenged traditional financial models by elimina ting intermediaries (Umarov  Umarov  & Umarov   2022). A pivotal moment in DeFi's journey was its increasing integration with traditional financial systems. Major financial  institutions in the U.S. began to recognize the potential of blockchain technology i n transforming finance. This  integration marked a shift in perception  positioning DeFi not just as an alternative but as a complementary component  of the broader financial ecosystem. This period saw significant investments from traditional financial entit ies into DeFi  projects  signaling a blending of the old with the new (Ozili  2022). Technological advancements and innovations have been at the heart of DeFi's growth in the U.S. Innovations such as  yield farming  liquidity mining  and the introduction of governance tokens have not only attracted a broader user base  but have also enhanced the functionality and efficiency of DeFi services. These innovations reflect the sector's  commitment to evolving and adapting to user needs and market dynamics (Umarov  Um arov  & Umarov  2022). The Ethereum Merge  which marked the transition of the Ethereum blockchain from proof -of-work (PoW) to proof-of- stake (PoS)  was another significant milestone for DeFi.,,weak,0.0026,1.0,1.0,0,0.3018

Originally built for internal agents   it was later enhanced to support external users  offering a seamless experience on d esktop  mobile  and tablet (iPad)  platforms. The redesign focused on creating a more intuitive and interactive interface while ensuring consistent  functionality across all devices. The system was built using Java  Spring MVC  Gradle  AngularJS  jQuery  and  FTL  with Oracle databases and both  REST and SOAP web services to connect smoothly with external systems. A modular design  clean coding standards   and automated testing with JUnit  HP ALM  and SonarQube helped ensure reliability and maintainability. Depl oyments  on Tomcat and WebLogic servers were carefully validated  keeping post-production issues to a minimum. Users benefited from faster  more responsive interfaces  and the system consistently handled transactions securely and  efficiently. The project‟s success was supported by strong collaboration across teams  structured delivery cycles  and  thoughtful attention to both technical and user experience considerations. Overall  the C2C Transfer System demonstrates how thoughtful design and careful engineeri ng can deliver a reliable   user-friendly  and scalable financial application ready for future growth.

Rahasak-CA Rahasak-CA is the certiﬁcate authority in Rahasak blockchain. The blockchain peers and clients public key certiﬁcates are issued by the Rahasak- CA. Apache Cassandra storage has been used as the certiﬁcate storage in Rahasak-CA. All the certiﬁcates issued by the Rahasak-CA will be stored in the Apache Cassandra storage. When bootstrapping a blockchain peer  it will generate a public-private key pair and submits the public key into Rahasak-CA. Then Rahasak-CA will digitally sign that public key and store it in the certiﬁcate storage. Then these certiﬁcates will be available for other peers and client in the blockchain network. Rahasak-CA exposes REST based API and Apache Kafka based streaming API to communicate. There are two main APIs available  1) certiﬁcate publish API  2) certiﬁcate search 17 API. Blockchain peers and clients submit their public keys into the certiﬁcate store via certiﬁcate publish API. The certiﬁcates in the Rahasak-CA can be searched via the certiﬁcate search API. 4.7. Microservice Deployment Each blockchain node in the network runs their own Aplos  Storage and Lokka services. All these services are Dockerized and available to deploy with Kubernetes container orchestration system. The administrator for each node(e.g system admin of the organization) needs to conﬁgure and deploy their own services. Kafka cluster needs to be deployed independently from the Aplos  Storage and Lokka services. For the service deployments  Rahasak provides docker-compose based deployment scripts as well as Kubernetes helm chart based deployment scripts. The Kubernetes container orchestra- tion system will manage the termination and recovery after the sudden failure of the microservices in each of the blockchain nodes. 5.

The amount of IoT devices is rapidly increasing. By 2025  forecasts suggest that there will be more than 75 billion IoT-connected devices in use  which is three times those deployed in 2019 (https://www.statista.com/statistics/471264/iot-number-of-connected- devices-worldwide/  (accessed on 28 March 2022)). The unprecedented amount of data collected by the IoT on the physical world  combined with cloud computing  promotes the development of new services  affecting many aspects of human daily life and with great market potential. Typical areas of application include manufacturing  smart city  supply chain  transportation  agriculture  energy management  environmental monitoring  and many others [16]. Lately  IoT devices have not only been exchanging data; an emerging trend is to enable Machine-to-Machine (M2M) payments  turning each connected device into a platform for selling and purchasing. By 2022  451 Research’s IoT Market Monitor expects that USD 7.5 billion in new transactions will be driven  in the US  through IoT payments (https://www. forbes.com/sites/jordanmckee/2019/10/09/the-internet-of-payments-has-arrived/?sh= 6faa22da3e69  (accessed on 28 March 2022)). A typical IoT architecture consists of things  gateways  and the cloud platform (see Figure 2) [ 17]. Usually  things support power-efﬁcient wireless technologies (e.g.  Lo- RaWAN [18]  Sigfox [19]) that  in order to limit the energy consumption and prolong the network lifetime  do not allow direct connection to the Internet. In this scenario  gateways are more powerful devices  usually not bounded by energy constraints  in charge of re- ceiving the wireless communications from the things and delivering the messages to the cloud platform over the Internet.,tps,weak,0.0024,1.0,1.0,0,0.3017

Everex partners with banks targeting underbanked populations and allows workers to send money home without paying high remittance fees. Merchants must be partnered with SureRemit and accept tokens. Everex needs to have licensed exchange partners in the country of receipt to exchange tokens into local currency. Cost of Compliance Among Different Regulatory Environments SureRemit leverages the Stellar platform and also acquires partner merchants to bypass different regulatory environments altogether by settling Remit tokens with ﬁat currency via Stellar. - The Token can only be used to make purchases with partner merchants. Therefore  the money cannot be used if a partner merchant does not accept the Remit token. - Interoperability SureRemit has standardized the process regardless of country.

Security,5,SUHXIEJV,Solutions to Scalability of Blockchain: A Survey,2020,Methodology,US Hybrid Consensus is a protocol that combines some classical consensus protocols. ByzCoin [25] proposes a two-phase protocol based on the idea of Bitcoin-NG [15]. However  it is able to ensure strong consistency by combining PoW and PBFT. In addition  ByzCoin uses a collective signing protocol called Cosi [71] to reduce the cost of the prepare and commit phases of PBFT and scale it to large consensus groups. Later works such as Hybrid consensus [72]  Solidus [73] also propose to combine different protocols with PoW aiming to improve on the throughput and security. Algorand [16] is a cryptocurrency based on a Byzantine Agreement (BA) protocol. By combining with V eriﬁable Random Functions [74]  users are chosen to become a com- mittee member to participate in the BA and reach consensus on the next set of transactions. To mitigate targeted attacks  the participant will be replaced after sending a message in BA. With all these approaches  Algorand scales to 500 000 users in experiments and achieves high throughput. f: OTHER CONSENSUS Some other new consensus algorithms have been proposed in recent years  including PoA (proof-of-authority) [75]  PoC (proof of capacity) [76] and PoP (proof-of-Participation) [77]  which make some modiﬁcations of the previous con- sensus to improve the scalability of blockchain. PoP (Proof of Participation) is a new protocol that imple- ments PoS through the mining mechanism of PoW. PoP selects a list of stakeholders to work out a computational task  which is simpler than that in PoW  to generate a new block. Other stakeholders who did not participate in the mining validate the block and propagate it. Unlike PoS  transaction fees in PoP are only distributed to stakeholders participat- ing in validation and propagation  which thus encourages stakeholders to maintain an online node and sustain the sys- tem. PoP includes two layers of security  proof-of-work  and proof-of-stake  that protect the system from security prob- lems (e.g. double-spending) and also consume less energy than the traditional PoW mechanism.

RS_ChangeList class representing a list of changes in LIS and its relations. ISPRS Int. J. Geo-Inf. 2021  10  35 10 of 22 The process of conducting changes in LIS basically relies on a single database table. However  implementing the history of changes has been proved to be a complex and error-prone task  with the examples of deliberate changes in the database tables [58]. This creates the opportunity and gives the motivation to secure such records on a blockchain. Furthermore  the mentioned table is append-only which means that apart from inserting new rows no other operations  such as update or delete  should be allowed. This is in line with the blockchain transaction recording capabilities. The main privacy issue related to transactions in LIS that has been witnessed in previous years is that the database containing transactions data can be compromised. There have been reported cases of deliberate or non-deliberate errors in the table of changes that might cause problems. Therefore  a lot of paper documents are kept supporting the integrity of data saved in the database. Blockchain may increase overall conﬁdence in the system. LIS data is public for reading except for personally sensitive information or details about restrictions (such as the value of a mortgage or creditor)  but only selected users can modify data in it according to the assigned roles and privileges. At this point  these are selected employees of the cadastre in charge of these activities. 4. Requirements for Blockchain-Based LIS In order to establish blockchain-based LIS  key requirements should be addressed to launch a blockchain-based cadastral system. This includes: • Analysis whether blockchain network should be public or private and authorised and how identity management will be handled. • What data will comprise one transaction in a blockchain. • How smart contracts will be used and what business logic should be implemented and executed on a blockchain. 4.1.

Vechainthor is an enhanced version of Blockchain. It is forked and improved based on  the Ethereum codebase. The following are the enhancements:  1. Tx format includes three new fields: ID  DependsOn  Blockref  and Expiration ;  2. Each Tx has its own ID; thereby  the application deals with a single Tx instead of a Tx bundle of Txs ;  3. Blockref delivers additional information about the previous  current  and next block. Also  it gives info about Tx  creation time. It will be helpful for financial purposes in case of acceptance delay  for example ;  4. Expiration is added to the Tx to avoid stacking for a long time. In addition  a Tx can do additional POW to speed  up the validation time (it can consume more to track miners' attention  but the extra pow will compensate its  loss);  5. Multi-task transaction: a Tx is composed of many small Txs to address the complex business payments. Vechain  uses Proof of Authority ""POA"" as a consensus algorithm that considers both stake and reputation. The maximum Tx speed announced is 10k Tx per second. As future work  they are looking for involving side chains  to enhance the scalability of  the vechain system. Vechainthor introduces the new multilayer payment model to ensure  the token stability price. Two tokens are utili zed to fulfill the Tx process: VET and VTHO. VET is the main token or""  smart money"" that represents the amounts been held by users. VET generates VTHO to cover the cost of smart contracts  and Tx payments. Using this payment method will stabilize the cost of the token.

A sub -chain is working separately after being created and registered inside the  parent chain. The parent ledger contains only detailed informat ion related to the sub -chains. Each sub -chain has its  ledger and can be created and registered any time under the parent chain network. Parent chain consensus is a  combination of POW  POS  and POL. Besides  its block creation time is 60 seconds. Its ledger  size is not affected by  the number of sub-chains since the parent chain runs independently of sub -chains.

Proof of Reputation (PoR) is a version of PoAuthority in which a reputable institution serves as the validator instead of an authorized identity. Trading platforms Gochain and Menlo one are now using PoR. Because a ﬁxed group of validators mining  the PoAuthority  and PoR algorithms make the blockchain network less decentralized  furthermore  they have not been thoroughly tested for performance and security issues [12]  [27]  [28]. E. DECENTRALIZED FINANCE DEFI AND SMART CONTRACTS Decentralized ﬁnance (DeFi) is a Blockchain-based ﬁnancial infrastructure that has recently grown in popularity. The term refers to a set of protocols established on open  unlicensed  and highly interoperable public smart contract systems  such as the Ethereum blockchain [6]  [18]. Traditional ﬁnancial services have been updated to be more open and transparent. The problem  in particular  does not rely on centralized orga- nizations or intermediaries. Instead  decentralized applica- tions and open protocols are used (DApps). The code ensures that agreements are followed  that transactions are safe and secure  and that allowed status changes are recorded on a public blockchain. As a result  this architecture can create an irreversible and highly interoperable ﬁnancial system with unparalleled transparency  equal access rights  and little need for custodians  central clearinghouses  or escrow services because ‘‘smart contracts’’ can handle the majority of these functions. DeFi uses a multi-layered architecture. Every layer has a distinct role. The layers are built on top of each other  resulting in an open and highly composable infrastructure that anyone can build on  rehash  or use. Here are the different layers of the DeFi stack [21]  [6]  for example: - The settlement layer allows the network to securely store ownership data and guarantees that any state changes adhere to its set of rules. - The asset layer: This category includes all assets issued on top of the settlement layer. This includes the native protocol asset as well as any other assets that have been issued on this Blockchain (usually referred to as tokens). - The protocol layer: The standards cover speciﬁc use cases such as decentralized exchanges  debt markets  derivatives  and on-chain asset management. These standards are commonly implemented as a set of open-access smart contracts (or DeFi applications).,security,weak,0.0028,1.2,1.0,0,0.3419

The decentralized  electronic ledger system will transform the way transactions  are carried out  changing the shape and size of the financial  sector.

Decentralized exchanges are typically facilitators of such transactions by offering a bookkeeping system that matches buyers and sellers.

Unveiling the Concept of Decentralized Finance (DeFi).  Decentralized Finance (DeFi) represents a paradigm shift in the financial sector  moving away from traditional   centralized systems towards a more open  transparent  and accessible framework. This innovative concept  primarily  built on the Ethereum platform  offers an alternative to conventional financial infrastructure  leveraging blockchain  technology to democratize financial services (Umarov  Umarov  & Umarov  2022). World Journal of Advanced Research and Reviews  2024  21(01)  2313–2328  2314  At its core  DeFi is a system where financial products become available on a public decentralized blockchain network   making them open to anyone to use  rather than going through intermediaries like banks or brokerages (dos Santos et  al.  2022). Unlike traditional finance  DeFi is characterized by its open -source nature  immutable transactions  and lack  of centralized control. This means that DeFi platforms operate without a central authority  using smart contracts - self- executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code. The emergence of DeFi can be traced back to the development of blockchain technology and the introduction of Bitcoin  in 2008  which laid the foundation for decentralized financial systems. However  it was the launch of Ethereum in 2015   a Turing -complete blockchain that significantl y expanded the scope of blockchain -based financial systems beyond  simple cryptocurrency transactions (dos Santos et al.  2022). Ethereum's introduction of smart contracts enabled the  creation of more complex financial services  such as lending  borrowing  and yield farming  all operating in a trustless  environment. DeFi's growth has been meteoric  with the total value locked (TVL) in DeFi protocols surging from a mere $4 billion to  over $100 billion in just a few years  reflecting its increasing popularity and the growing trust in its underlying  technology (Jensen  von Wachter  & Ross  2021). This explosive growth can be attributed to several factors  including  the transparency of blockchain technology  the potential for higher returns compared to traditiona l banking  and the  inclusivity and accessibility of DeFi platforms. One of the most significant advantages of DeFi is its potential to offer financial services to the unbanked and  underbanked populations.,,weak,0.0024,1.2,1.0,0,0.3417
Security,14,95TMJST6,Blockchain as IoT Economy Enabler: A Review of Architectural Aspects,2022,Introduction,The Internet of Things (IoT) is a network of tiny devices connected over the Internet to observe the physical world  gather data  and consciously act on it in a useful way. Billions of connected IoT devices are expected to bring a substantial added value for communities and for individuals  also in view of the fact that IoT is tightly connected with several well-known trends  such as Big Data  smart cities  and Industry 4.0  which promise to deeply change many aspects of our lives in the future. As an example  the unprecedented amount of data gathered by billions of IoT sensors will bring us the ability to get new insights and actionable intelligence regarding our world [1 2]. The pervasive presence of smart connected devices will enable the development of innovative services to improve our lives [3] and to face new and unexpected challenges  such as the COVID-19 outbreak [4]  and private and public objects (i.e.  things) will be available to anyone for renting  even for a short time  to support a new form of shared economy [5]. The general problem of giving a reward to subjects that contribute to this novel added value ecosystem is not only an economic or business-related question. Many IoT applications are peculiar regarding the amount of involved users  the volume and diversity of generated data  the frequency of economic transactions and their latency constraints  J. Sens. Actuator Netw. 2022  11  20. https://doi.org/10.3390/jsan11020020 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/jsan J. Sens. Actuator Netw. 2022  11  20 2 of 36 as well as security requirements. Hence  related technical and architectural aspects are by themselves an interesting cross-cutting dimension for many IoT applications. This is even more compelling if we observe that decentralization is going to be a fundamental aspect of evolved IoT ecosystems. In fact  a single organization handling a vast amount of heterogeneous and pervasive IoT devices is not simply unrealistic  but also unfeasible. We expect that in the more complex scenarios  many organizations will contribute to a single IoT ecosystem. Furthermore  the pervasive nature of IoT deployments usually requires the involvement of end-users that buy  deploy  and contribute their devices to an ecosystem on the basis of some kind of future advantage. Ecosystems of this kind grow as more people are willing to contribute  and not (only) under the pressure of centralized investments.,latency; tps; security,weak,0.0024,1.2,1.0,0,0.3417

As a forerunner of public BoBs  Polkadot [130] standardizes the method for passing mes- sages between parallel chains of homogenous relay networks. It acknowledges the interoperabil- ity of parallel chains  which may engage in cross-chain interactions to reinforce the performance of one another. A standard created by Polkadot 2.0 called XCM [17] enables protocol design- ers to specify the types of data and sources from which their chains can send and receive data. It comes with one virtual machine that enables flexible execution and one virtual machine al- lows for adaptable execution. Another pioneer in the BoBs ecosystem is Cosmos. According to the IBC [67]  Cosmos is an end-to-end  connection-oriented  stateful protocol used to provide authenticated  reliable communication across diverse blockchains arranged in a dynamic topol- ogy. These advancements in the Polkadot ecosystem enhance the versatility and e fficiency of cross-chain communication and execution  ultimately contributing to the broader development of blockchain technology. Chainlink created CCIP [32]  focusing on end-to-end security  futur- istic interoperability  and an easy development process. The CCIP infrastructure consists of three layers: a message layer (programmable pass bridge)  a transport layer (CCIP core)  and a decen- tralized prophet network (DON) based on the OCR2.0 protocol. External developers only need to develop sender and receiver contracts  all other components are included in the CCIP service  and the developers can easily interact across chains through a unified interface. LayerZero [153] is a trustless interoperability protocol  which provides a powerful  low-level communication prim- itive upon which a diverse set of cross-chain applications can be built. Aion [112] enables the decentralized internet and supports a public cross-chain with the Aion Virtual Machine.,security,weak,0.0024,1.2,1.0,0,0.3417

Milestones in DeFi Development in the U.S. The evolution of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) in the United States is a testament to the dynamic interplay between  technological innovation and financial services. The journey of DeFi  from its nascent stages to becoming a significant  part of the financial landscape  is marked by several key milestones that reflect its growing impact and integration into  the broader economy. The early stages of DeFi's development coincided with the advent of blockchain technology and the introduction of  Bitcoin in 2008. However  it was the launch of Ethereum in 2015  with its groundbreaking smart contract capabilities   that truly set the stage for the DeFi revolution. The United States  known for its innovative spirit and technological  prowess  quickly emerged as a fertile  ground for the growth and development of DeFi applications. Protocols such as  MakerDAO  Compound  and Uniswap gained prominence  offering decentralized services like lending  borrowing  and  trading  which challenged traditional financial models by elimina ting intermediaries (Umarov  Umarov  & Umarov   2022). A pivotal moment in DeFi's journey was its increasing integration with traditional financial systems. Major financial  institutions in the U.S. began to recognize the potential of blockchain technology i n transforming finance. This  integration marked a shift in perception  positioning DeFi not just as an alternative but as a complementary component  of the broader financial ecosystem. This period saw significant investments from traditional financial entit ies into DeFi  projects  signaling a blending of the old with the new (Ozili  2022). Technological advancements and innovations have been at the heart of DeFi's growth in the U.S. Innovations such as  yield farming  liquidity mining  and the introduction of governance tokens have not only attracted a broader user base  but have also enhanced the functionality and efficiency of DeFi services. These innovations reflect the sector's  commitment to evolving and adapting to user needs and market dynamics (Umarov  Um arov  & Umarov  2022). The Ethereum Merge  which marked the transition of the Ethereum blockchain from proof -of-work (PoW) to proof-of- stake (PoS)  was another significant milestone for DeFi.,,weak,0.0026,1.0,1.0,0,0.3018

Originally built for internal agents   it was later enhanced to support external users  offering a seamless experience on d esktop  mobile  and tablet (iPad)  platforms. The redesign focused on creating a more intuitive and interactive interface while ensuring consistent  functionality across all devices. The system was built using Java  Spring MVC  Gradle  AngularJS  jQuery  and  FTL  with Oracle databases and both  REST and SOAP web services to connect smoothly with external systems. A modular design  clean coding standards   and automated testing with JUnit  HP ALM  and SonarQube helped ensure reliability and maintainability. Depl oyments  on Tomcat and WebLogic servers were carefully validated  keeping post-production issues to a minimum. Users benefited from faster  more responsive interfaces  and the system consistently handled transactions securely and  efficiently. The project‟s success was supported by strong collaboration across teams  structured delivery cycles  and  thoughtful attention to both technical and user experience considerations. Overall  the C2C Transfer System demonstrates how thoughtful design and careful engineeri ng can deliver a reliable   user-friendly  and scalable financial application ready for future growth.

Rahasak-CA Rahasak-CA is the certiﬁcate authority in Rahasak blockchain. The blockchain peers and clients public key certiﬁcates are issued by the Rahasak- CA. Apache Cassandra storage has been used as the certiﬁcate storage in Rahasak-CA. All the certiﬁcates issued by the Rahasak-CA will be stored in the Apache Cassandra storage. When bootstrapping a blockchain peer  it will generate a public-private key pair and submits the public key into Rahasak-CA. Then Rahasak-CA will digitally sign that public key and store it in the certiﬁcate storage. Then these certiﬁcates will be available for other peers and client in the blockchain network. Rahasak-CA exposes REST based API and Apache Kafka based streaming API to communicate. There are two main APIs available  1) certiﬁcate publish API  2) certiﬁcate search 17 API. Blockchain peers and clients submit their public keys into the certiﬁcate store via certiﬁcate publish API. The certiﬁcates in the Rahasak-CA can be searched via the certiﬁcate search API. 4.7. Microservice Deployment Each blockchain node in the network runs their own Aplos  Storage and Lokka services. All these services are Dockerized and available to deploy with Kubernetes container orchestration system. The administrator for each node(e.g system admin of the organization) needs to conﬁgure and deploy their own services. Kafka cluster needs to be deployed independently from the Aplos  Storage and Lokka services. For the service deployments  Rahasak provides docker-compose based deployment scripts as well as Kubernetes helm chart based deployment scripts. The Kubernetes container orchestra- tion system will manage the termination and recovery after the sudden failure of the microservices in each of the blockchain nodes. 5.

Typical areas of application include manufacturing  smart city  supply chain  transportation  agriculture  energy management  environmental monitoring  and many others [16]. Lately  IoT devices have not only been exchanging data; an emerging trend is to enable Machine-to-Machine (M2M) payments  turning each connected device into a platform for selling and purchasing.
