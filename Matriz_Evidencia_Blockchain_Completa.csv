As the number of transactions increased from 500 to 1500, the system maintained high throughput and consistent validation accuracy without the need for any token -based incentives. The average block finalization time remained under 2.5 seconds, even at peak loads, indicating the model’s scalability and efficiency. Network latency was observed to be minimal due to the lightweight consensus mechanism, and no double-spending or malicious tampering was detected during the simulation. Additionally, the proposed token-less approach exhibited faster transaction confirmation times compared to traditional blockchain systems that rely on mining or token staking. These results confirm the DTL-B model’s capability to support real-time, high-volume banking operations with enhanced security, reduced overhead, and improved trust among participating entities.

Bitcoin's Proof of Work (PoW) method processes 7 TPS, whereas Ethereum manages 30 TPS. These constraints might cause delays and higher costs amid solid demand, such as market volatility when network congestion raises transaction rates. However, highthroughput blockchain networks like Solana or Algorand can handle thousands of transactions per second. FinTech application performance depends on the chosen blockchain platform and consensus mechanism (Hua et al., 2019). Layer 2 technologies like Bitcoin's Lightning Network or Ethereum rollups execute transactions off the leading network while retaining security to speed up transactions. These advancements boost performance for high-frequency trading and other time-sensitive financial applications, proving the significance of choosing the correct technology. Scalability Challenges Scalability is a system's capacity to accommodate more transactions without sacrificing performance. It is essential in FinTech since users and transactions expand dramatically. The ""blockchain trilemma""—trade-offs between decentralization, security, and performance— makes scaling traditional blockchains challenging. Different scaling solutions have been explored. Sharding divides the blockchain into manageable chunks that can execute transactions simultaneously. This strategy boosts speed but needs intricate shard coordination to preserve security and data integrity.",N/A

Furthermore, blockchain can be used to create trust and reduce fraud ( Mainelli and Smith, 2015 ). In addition to these benefits, blockchain techno logy offers opportunities for banks to gain a competitive advantage in terms of economy vi rtualisation over their competitors and introduce new services in future. Although blockchain may bring enormous benefits and opportunities to the banking industry and give birth to a whole new generation of services (Ølnes et al. , 2017 ), there remains significant risk and cost implication of adopting the technology ( Atzori, 2015 ; Ølnes et al. , 2017 ). As shown in Table 3 , various risk factors such as scalability, security risks, interoperability reversibility and regul atory risks are some of the main challenges facing blockchain technolo gy. In addition, operating cost (transaction costs, energy costs, storage costs) of blo ckchain technology are some of the other challenges for banks. Such issues need to be taken into consideration before the mass adoption of these technologies in this field.

Clohessy and Acton (2019) examined the primary reasons of organisations adopting blockchain and found that the intention to adopt was related to benefits such as reduced costs, enhanced security, efficiency and transparency of the transaction. 5.3 Vindicating blockchain risks for banking and finance services Banks adopting new technologies such as blockchain must be prepared to tackle technical and operational risk, regulatory and legal risk as well as reputation risk that may arise from these (Pennathur, 2001; Bauer and Hein, 2006; Deshpande et al., 2017) The Basel committee report defines operational risk as to the potential for loss due to significant deficiencies in system reliability and integrity. The Federal Deposit Insurance Company describes this risk as hardware/software failures, disruptions, protections, systems or database compromise. Operational risk is mainly arising from external hacking. Hackers may obtain confidential information by manipulating data or altering account balances (Attaran and Gunasekaran, 2019). For example, when small banks outsource their web operations, internal controls may not cover vendors who establish web-based functionalities (Pennathur, 2001). In addition, customers may intentionally or unintentionally misuse the website leading to an increase in operational risk. Overall, inadequate technical and operational controls, policies and procedures can create operational and security risk that can lead to theft and fraud in a digital environment (Deshpande et al., 2017). These issues can ultimately influence the reputation of the banks, a critical risk, as relationships in the sector are based on trust (Fiordelisi et al., 2014). From a technical point of view, several issues need to be investigated and taken into consideration that may potentially affect the use of blockchain technology to deliver sectorleading banking and finance processes. Issues such as scalability, security and interoperability and reversibility are some of the technological challenges highlighted in the Blockchain for existing literature (e.g. Vukoli/C19 c, 2015; Ølnes, 2016; Cerme~no, 2016) that the banking and banking and finance sector could face when using blockchain technology.

Nonetheless, as much as blockchain has brought opportunities for organisations, it is pivotal to realise that there will be several challenges and complexities across technical, regulatory and adoption-related areas (Attaran and Gunasekaran, 2019). Recent events such as digital currency theft and cybersecurity breaches have demonstrated the high-level of risks related to the use of blockchain technologies in banking and finance (Deshpande et al., 2017; Attaran; Gunasekaran, 2019). While exploiting the potential of new-disruptive technologies, specifically blockchain, it is equally vital to comprehend the potential benefits, risk and challenges associated with them to mitigate risks and avoid the technical, social and political consequences of failure. Therefore, this study aims to outline blockchain’s benefits, opportunities, costs, risks, as well as challenges of technology in the context of banking and finance services. The remainder of this paper is organised as follows: section two presents a state of the art review of blockchain technology within the banking and finance sectors. This is followed by highlighting the overall challenges of blockchain technology in section three. After that, in section four, the integrative literature review methodology is then introduced. Section five, cost, benefit, risk and opportunities framework is then introduced to examine blockchain technology within the banking and finance sector. After that, section six presents the discussions, and finally, section seven offers the concluding remarks of the study. 2. Blockchain for next generation banking and financial services Financial technologies have created a new paradigm shift in driving innovation in the financial sector, and blockchain technology is a significant part of this transformation (Lee and Shin, 2018). While there has been a wide range of traditional banking products from payments to investment services, blockchain technology has challenged this through offering innovative, more secured and faster transfers at lower costs (Lee and Shin, 2018). Blockchain technology can be explained, as “A blockchain is essentially a distributed database of records or public ledger of all transactions or digital events that have been executed and shared among participating parties. Each transaction in the public ledger is verified by the consensus of a majority of the participants in the system.",N/A

These research questions are important because often implementations of IM typically do not follow specific guidelines [25]. Secondly, as pointed out by [8, 12] there is still a lack of supporting tools for IMs, such as monitoring tools (e.g., visualization and analysis of cross-chain transactions and state), cross-chain digital identity, migration tools (change the DLT infrastructure on the go for a dApp or mDApp), security tools (automatic detection of frontrunning attacks, formal analysis of cross-chain protocols), and others. Following the reasoning line of this work, there are still no methods to systematically evaluate and compare the performance of an IM.

Finally, regulation on cross-chain asset transfers, mainly among institutional players, will significantly impact how modern financial systems interact and evolve.

Conflicting regulations between jurisdictions lead to uncertainty and discourage institutions from engaging with these types of blockchain solutions without defined guidance. How to overcome the challenges recommended actions To overcome those challenges, the study policy recommendations are as follows: Adopting Sharding and Layer2 Solutions: For instance, to enhance scalability and decrease latency, methods such as sharding that split the entire blockchain network into smaller segments for parallel processing and layer2 solutions that transfer transactions to secondary layers can be utilized (Xu et al., 2022). Create Standardized Protocols: Crossindustry initiatives in establishing standards for integrating blockchain with legacy systems will help ease adoption. These protocols should balance security, interoperability, and efficiency (Zhang et al., 2021). Improve Coordination among Regulators: By working with regulators to establish clear and consistent frameworks, blockchain systems can ensure compliance and foster trust. Regulatory clarity is one of the important factors in protecting user's interests while promoting innovation, Peters and Panayi (2016) highlighted this statement. Fine tune consensus mechanisms: Adopting more efficient consensus mechanisms, like Raft or proof of stake, can cut down on waste compared to replicas that need to constantly stay in sync, as not all replicas need to read every log or write during every block. Practical Implications The findings present several implications for financial institutions: · Increased Security and Transparency: With an immutable audit trail provided by the blockchain, it helps with regulatory compliance and operational transparency, in turn reducing fraud and errors. · Cost Efficiency: Smart contracts automate procedures to lower human involvement leading to enhanced efficiency and lower costs. · Strategic Investment: Beyond technical advantages, institutions should evaluate the cost of integration and limited scalability versus the potential benefits of blockchain.

Future innovations shall envisage a runway incorporating AI and blockchain technology with optimized security and solutions. Figure 4: Blockchain Compliance Monitoring: Risk Assessment 5. Challenges and Future Directions Despite the large benefits of using blockchain technology for banking security and transparency, the extensive acceptance of blockchain faces a multitude of challenging issues. These include, but are not limited to, such limitations as scalability issues, regulatory concerns around accepting blockchain languorously, interoperability between blockchain platforms, and the high computational costs associated with blockchain networks. Yet, improvements in AI, quantum-resistance cryptography, and cross-chain interoperability are expected to be significant in facing these challenges and driving blockchain adoption at financial institutions. 5.1 Challenges in Blockchain Adoption for Banking Security 5.1.1 Scalability Issues Legacy blockchain architecture, such as Bitcoin, or Ethereum, invariably causes slow transaction rates, primarily due to the Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanism. High transaction fees and energy consumption continue to hinder blockchain's scalability in banking transactions with high throughput. Potential Solution: Layer-2 scaling solutions like Lightning Network and Rollups can increase transaction speed and efficiency. 5.1.2 Regulatory Uncertainty Global financial regulations that do not completely adapt blockchain-based transactions lend themselves to legal and compliance uncertainties.

By leveraging decentralized and immutable ledgers, Blockchain provides a Farayola, P.No. 501-514 Page 510 tamper-proof record of transactional data, making it virtually impossible for unauthorized parties to alter or manipulate transaction records. The implementation of Blockchain involves deploying distributed ledger technology (DLT) to create a secure and transparent transactional framework for banking operations. Smart contracts, powered by Blockchain, enable automated and secure execution of transactions, further enhancing efficiency and reducing the risk of fraud. Moreover, the integration of Blockchain with existing banking systems requires careful consideration of interoperability, scalability, and regulatory compliance to ensure seamless adoption and integration. Business Intelligence (BI) complements AI and Blockchain by providing data-driven insights that inform decision-making and enhance cyber security measures.",N/A

For instance, a transaction chain that moves through a series of low-KYC wallets or bridges into privacy coins can be flagged for enhanced due diligence [20]. Similarly, AI can detect structuring behavior where users break large transfers into smaller ones to evade reporting thresholds by identifying frequency, timing, and destination patterns that collectively indicate evasion tactics. Real-time AML frameworks also benefit from access to external signals. News sentiment analysis, politically exposed person (PEP) databases, sanctions lists, and darknet transaction monitoring can be integrated via APIs into centralized alert engines. The fusion of on-chain and off-chain data helps eliminate false positives while escalating genuinely anomalous activity to compliance officers. Cross-institutional alert sharing is another frontier. With unified data layers, multiple banks and platforms can share red-flagged entities while preserving privacy through secure multiparty computation (SMPC) or zero-knowledge proofs [21]. Moreover, adaptive risk scoring ensures that thresholds evolve dynamically with changes in user behavior, rather than relying on static rulesets. As shown in Figure 3, a compliance dashboard fed by AI models can present investigators with alert explanations, transaction chains, and user behavior graphs. This layered visualization approach improves auditability and ensures that alert disposition aligns with evolving regulatory requirements [22]. 4.3. Regulatory Standards (e.g., FATF, GDPR, PSD2) and Cross-Border Data Management Financial compliance is not only a technical concern but a jurisdictional labyrinth shaped by overlapping international standards and regional mandates. Key among these is the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) framework, which establishes AML/CTF principles that countries must translate into national law. Adherence to FATF’s 40 Recommendations has become a prerequisite for global financial legitimacy [23]. These recommendations underscore the importance of effective CDD, beneficial ownership transparency, and suspicious transaction reporting tasks that unified data architectures can operationalize efficiently. Meanwhile, General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) introduces a different set of constraints by prioritizing user privacy and data sovereignty.",N/A

However, banks often face challenges in accessing and managing diverse datasets dispersed across multiple systems and platforms. Moreover, the complex and dynamic nature of financial data poses challenges for AI algorithms, which must continuously adapt to changing patterns and behaviors to detect and mitigate emerging threats. Similarly, Blockchain technology presents technical challenges related to scalability, interoperability, and performance. While Blockchain offers a decentralized and immutable ledger for secure transactions, its scalability remains a concern, particularly in high-volume banking environments. Interoperability between different Blockchain platforms and legacy systems is also a challenge, requiring banks to invest in integration solutions and standards to ensure seamless data exchange. Additionally, the computational resources required for Blockchain consensus mechanisms impose performance limitations that may impact transaction speed and efficiency. Organizational challenges represent another barrier to the integration of AI, Blockchain, and BI in banking security. Banks must navigate complex organizational structures, legacy systems, and cultural barriers that may impede innovation and collaboration. Resistance to Farayola, P.No.",N/A

However, there are several issues that impact DLTs achieving interoperability with either other DLTs or legacy systems, such as tolerance for diversification, the confirmation of atomicity, security, enhancement of efficiency and friendliness to software developers Other challenges faced by DLT interoperability comprise how to support reliable access control for smart contracts. While any access policy can possibly be deployed and enforced within a stand-alone smart contract, a good security protocol involves decoupling control policy and enforcement from definite data access (Tenorio-Fornes et al. 2021). Another issue relates to how to support common cross-DLT transactions, for example in blockchains where they are different to cross-chain deals and atomic swaps. A well-known challenge is how to facilitate communication among smart contracts, which is presently not feasible for contracts in different DLTs (Dinh, Datta, and Ooi 2019). Data standardisation is another challenge faced in achieving DLT interoperability. For collaborators to share information within or across different DLT platforms, all data must adhere to a similar data format to ensure standardisation as this helps all stakeholders to understand the information presented. However, most DLTs employ different standardised data representation, which makes DLT platforms interoperability difficult and results in different standards with diverse data attributes (Hewett, van Gogh, and Moreover, different legal frameworks are employed by DLTs across the world. Hence, it can be challenging to determine data owner across the distributed ledger network because of the decentralised characteristics of DLT platforms, which makes it difficult to specify who is legally in charge of interoperable DLTs (Wang 2021).
